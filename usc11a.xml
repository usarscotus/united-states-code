The effect of the amendment is to require that procedural rules promulgated pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2075 be consistent with the bankruptcy statute, both titles 11 and 28 U.S.C. Thus, although Rule 1001 sets forth the scope of the bankruptcy rules and forms, any procedural matters contained in title 11 or 28 U.S.C. with respect to cases filed under 11 U.S.C. would control. See 1 Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶ 3.04 [2][c] (15th ed. 1980).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">28 U.S.C. § 151 establishes a United States Bankruptcy Court in each district as an adjunct to the district court. This provision does not, however, become effective until <date date="1984-04-01">April 1, 1984</date>. <ref href="/us/pl/95/598/s402/b">Public Law 95–598, § 402(b)</ref>. From <date date="1979-10-01">October 1, 1979</date> through <date date="1984-03-31">March 31, 1984</date>, the courts of bankruptcy as defined in § 1(10) of the Bankruptcy Act, and created in § 2a of that Act continue to be the courts of bankruptcy. <ref href="/us/pl/95/598/s404/a">Public Law 95–598, § 404(a)</ref>. From their effective date these rules and forms are to be applicable in cases filed under chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 of title 11 regardless of whether the court is established by the Bankruptcy Act or by 28 U.S.C. § 151. Rule 9001 contains a broad and general definition of “bankruptcy court,” “court” and “United States Bankruptcy Court” for this purpose.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">“Bankruptcy Code” or “Code” as used in these rules means title 11 of the United States Code, the codification of the bankruptcy law. <ref href="/us/pl/95/598/s101">Public Law 95–598, § 101</ref>. See Rule 9001.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">“Bankruptcy Act” as used in the notes to these rules means the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 as amended which was repealed by <ref href="/us/pl/95/598/s401/a">§ 401(a) of Public Law 95–598</ref>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These rules apply to all cases filed under the Code except as otherwise specifically stated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The final sentence of the rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 903. The objective of “expeditious and economical administration” of cases under the Code has frequently been recognized by the courts to be “a chief purpose of the bankruptcy laws.” See <i>Katchen v. Landy</i>, 382 U.S. 323, 328 (1966): <i>Bailey v. Glover</i>, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 342, 346–47 (1874): <i>Ex parte Christy</i>, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 292, 312–14, 320–22 (1845). The rule also incorporates the wholesome mandate of the last sentence of Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 2 Moore, <i>Federal Practice</i> ¶ 1.13 (2d ed. 1980); 4 Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure-Civil</i> § 1029 (1969).</p>

L. No. 98–353, <ref href="/us/stat/98/333">98 Stat. 333</ref> (hereinafter the 1984 amendments), created a new bankruptcy judicial system in which the role of the district court was substantially increased. 28 U.S.C. § 1334 confers on the United States district courts original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases under title 11 of the United States Code and original but not exclusive jurisdiction over civil proceedings arising under title 11 and civil proceedings arising in or related to a case under title 11.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(a) the district court may but need not refer cases and proceedings within the district court’s jurisdiction to the bankruptcy judges for the district. Judgments or orders of the bankruptcy judges entered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1) and (c)(2) are subject to appellate review by the district courts or bankruptcy appellate panels under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 81(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. provides that the civil rules do not apply to proceedings in bankruptcy, except as they may be made applicable by rules promulgated by the Supreme Court, <i>e.g</i>., Part VII of these rules. This amended Bankruptcy Rule 1001 makes the Bankruptcy Rules applicable to cases and proceedings under title 11, whether before the district judges or the bankruptcy judges of the district.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The word “administered” is added to recognize the affirmative duty of the court to exercise the authority conferred by these rules to ensure that bankruptcy cases and the proceedings within them are resolved not only fairly, but also without undue cost or delay. As officers of the court, attorneys share this responsibility with the judge to whom the case is assigned.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The addition of the phrase “employed by the court and the parties” emphasizes that parties share in the duty of using the rules to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every case and proceeding. Achievement of this goal depends upon cooperative and proportional use of procedure by lawyers and parties.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This amendment does not create a new or independent source of sanctions. Nor does it abridge the scope of any other of these rules.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b47403c-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2024 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Bankruptcy Rules are the fifth set of national procedural rules to be restyled. The restyled Rules of Appellate Procedure took effect in 1998. The restyled Rules of Criminal Procedure took effect in 2002. The restyled Rules of Civil Procedure took effect in 2007. The restyled Rules of Evidence took effect in 2011. The restyled Bankruptcy Rules apply the same general drafting guidelines and principles used in restyling the Appellate, Criminal, Civil, and Evidence Rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">General Guidelines. Guidance in drafting, usage, and style was provided by Bryan A. Garner, <i>Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules</i>, Administrative Office of the United States Courts (1996) and Bryan A. Garner, <i>Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage</i> (2d ed. 1995). <i>See also</i> Joseph Kimble, <i>Guiding Principles for Restyling the Civil Rules</i>, in Preliminary Draft of Proposed Style Revision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, at Mich. Bar J., Sept. 2005, at 56 and Mich. Bar J., Oct. 2005, at 52; Joseph Kimble, <i>Lessons in Drafting from the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, 12 Scribes J. Legal Writing 25 (2008–2009).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Formatting Changes. Many of the changes in the restyled Bankruptcy Rules result from using format to achieve clearer presentations. The rules are broken down into constituent parts, using progressively indented subparagraphs with headings and substituting vertical for horizontal lists. “Hanging indents” are used throughout. These formatting changes make the structure of the rules graphic and make the restyled rules easier to read and understand even when the words are not changed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Changes to Reduce Inconsistent, Ambiguous, Redundant, Repetitive, or Archaic Words. The restyled rules reduce the use of inconsistent terms that say the same thing in different ways. Because different words are presumed to have different meanings, such inconsistencies can result in confusion. The restyled rules reduce inconsistencies by using the same words to express the same meaning. The restyled rules also minimize the use of inherently ambiguous words. The restyled rules minimize the use of redundant “intensifiers.” These are expressions that attempt to add emphasis, but instead state the obvious and create negative implications for other rules. The absence of intensifiers in the restyled rules does not change their substantive meaning. The restyled rules also remove words and concepts that are outdated or redundant.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule Numbers. The restyled rules keep the same numbers to minimize the effect on research. Subdivisions have been rearranged within some rules to achieve greater clarity and simplicity.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">No Substantive Change. The style changes to the rules are intended to make no changes in substantive meaning. The Committee made special efforts to reject any purported style improvement that might result in a substantive change in the application of a rule. The Committee also declined to modify “sacred phrases”—those that have become so familiar in practice that to alter them would be unduly disruptive to practice and expectations. An example in the Bankruptcy Rules would be “meeting of creditors.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Legislative Rules. In those cases in which Congress enacted a rule by statute, in particular Rule 2002(n) (Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98–353, <ref href="/us/stat/98/333">98 Stat. 333</ref>, 357), Rule 3001(g) (98 Stat. at 361), and Rule 7004(b) and (h) (Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103–394, <ref href="/us/stat/108/4106">108 Stat. 4106</ref>, 4118), the Committee has not restyled the rule.</p>

The voluntary petition may request relief under chapter 7, 9, 11, or 13 whereas an involuntary petition may be filed only under chapter 7 or 11. Section 109 of the Code specifies the types of debtors for whom the different forms of relief are available and § 303(a) indicates the persons against whom involuntary petitions may be filed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule in subdivision (a) is in harmony with the Code in that it requires the filing to be with the bankruptcy court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The number of copies of the petition to be filed is specified in this rule but a local rule may require additional copies. This rule provides for filing sufficient copies for the court’s files and for the trustee in a chapter 7 or 13 case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Official Form No. 1 may be used to seek relief voluntarily under any of the chapters. Only the original need be signed and verified, but the copies must be conformed to the original. See Rules 1008 and 9011(c). As provided in § 362(a) of the Code, the filing of a petition acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings against the debtor, property of the debtor, and property of the estate.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b474044-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rules 1002(a), governing a voluntary petition, 1003(a), governing an involuntary petition, and 1003(e), governing a petition in a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding, are combined into this Rule 1002. If a bankruptcy clerk has been appointed for the district, the petition is filed with the bankruptcy clerk. Otherwise, the petition is filed with the clerk of the district court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The elimination of the reference to the Official Forms of the petition is not intended to change the practice. Rule 9009 provides that the Official Forms “shall be observed and used” in cases and proceedings under the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> which provided for the distribution of copies of the petition to agencies of the United States has been deleted. Some of these agencies no longer wish to receive copies of the petition, while others not included in subdivision (b) have now requested copies. The Director of the Administrative Office will determine on an ongoing basis which government agencies will be provided a copy of the petition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The number of copies of a petition that must be filed is a matter for local rule.</p>

The duties of the United States trustee pursuant to the Code and 28 U.S.C. § 586(a) require that the United States trustee be apprised of the commencement of every case under chapters 7, 11, 12 and 13 and this is most easily accomplished by providing that office with a copy of the petition. Although 28 U.S.C. § 586(a) does not give the United States trustee an administrative role in chapter 9 cases, § 1102 of the Code requires the United States trustee to appoint committees and that section is applicable in chapter 9 cases pursuant to § 901(a). It is therefore appropriate that the United States trustee receive a copy of every chapter 9 petition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Notwithstanding subdivision (b), pursuant to Rule 5005(b)(3), the clerk is not required to transmit a copy of the petition to the United States trustee if the United States trustee requests that it not be transmitted. Many rules require the clerk to transmit a certain document to the United States trustee, but Rule 5005(b)(3) relieves the clerk of that duty under this or any other rule if the United States trustee requests that such document not be transmitted.</p>

Official Form No. 11 (Involuntary Case: Creditors’ Petition), is prescribed for use by petitioning creditors to have a debtor’s assets liquidated under chapter 7 of the Code or the business reorganized under chapter 11. It contains the required allegations as specified in § 303(b) of the Code. Official Form 12 is prescribed for use by fewer than all the general partners to obtain relief for the partnership as governed by § 303(b)(3) of the Code and Rule 1004(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although the number of copies to be filed is specified in Rule 1002, a local rule may require additional copies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Only the original need be signed and verified, but the copies must be conformed to the original. See Rules 1008 and 9011(c). The petition must be filed with the bankruptcy court. This provision implements § 303(b) which provides that an involuntary case is commenced by filing the petition with the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As provided in § 362 of the Code, the filing of the petition acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings against the debtor, the debtor’s property and property of the estate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> retains the explicitness of former Bankruptcy Rule 104(d) that a transfer of a claim for the purpose of commencing a case under the Code is a ground for disqualification of a party to the transfer as a petitioner.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 303(b) “is not intended to overrule Bankruptcy Rule 104(d), which places certain restrictions on the transfer of claims for the purpose of commencing an involuntary case.” House Report No. 95–595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 322; Senate Report No. 95–989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978) 33.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The subdivision requires disclosure of any transfer of the petitioner’s claim as well as a transfer to the petitioner and applies to transfers for security as well as unconditional transfers, <i>Cf. In re 69th &amp; Crandon Bldg. Corp</i>., 97 F.2d 392, 395 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 629 (1938), recognizing the right of a creditor to sign a bankruptcy petition notwithstanding a prior assignment of his claim for the purpose of security. This rule does not, however, qualify the requirement of § 303(b)(1) that a petitioning creditor must have a claim not contingent as to liability.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. Section 303(c) of the Code permits a creditor to join in the petition at any time before the case is dismissed or relief is ordered. While this rule does not require the court to give all creditors notice of the petition, the list of creditors filed by the debtor affords a petitioner the information needed to enable him to give notice for the purpose of obtaining the co-petitioners required to make the petition sufficient. After a reasonable opportunity has been afforded other creditors to join in an involuntary petition, the hearing on the petition should be held without further delay.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. This subdivision implements § 304. A petition for relief under § 304 may only be filed by a foreign representative who is defined in § 101(20) generally as a representative of an estate in a foreign proceeding. The term “foreign proceeding” is defined in § 101(19).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 304(b) permits a petition filed thereunder to be contested by a party in interest. Subdivision (e)(2) therefore requires that the summons and petition be served on any person against whom the relief permitted by § 304(b) is sought as well as on any other party the court may direct.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rules applicable to the procedure when an involuntary petition is filed are made applicable generally when a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is commenced. These rules include Rule 1010 with respect to issuance and service of a summons, Rule 1011 concerning responsive pleadings and motions, and Rule 1018 which makes various rules in Part VII applicable in proceedings on contested petitions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The venue for a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1474.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> specifies that while all general partners must consent to the filing of a voluntary petition, it is not necessary that they all execute the petition. It may be executed and filed on behalf of the partnership by fewer than all.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> implements § 303(b)(3) of the Code which provides that an involuntary petition may be filed by fewer than all the general partners or, when all the general partners are debtors, by a general partner, trustee of the partner or creditors of the partnership. Rule 1010, which governs service of a petition and summons in an involuntary case, specifies the time and mode of service on the partnership. When a petition is filed against a partnership under § 303(b)(3), this rule requires an additional service on the nonfiling general partners. It is the purpose of this subdivision to protect the interests of the nonpetitioning partners and the partnership.</p>

There is no counterpart provision in the Code setting out the manner in which a partnership commences a voluntary case. The Supreme Court has held in the corporate context that applicable nonbankruptcy law determines whether authority exists for a particular debtor to commence a bankruptcy case. <i>See Price v. Gurney</i>, 324 U.S. 100 (1945). The lower courts have followed this rule in the partnership context as well. <i>See, e.g., Jolly v. Pittore</i>, 170 B.R. 793 (S.D.N.Y. 1994); <i>Union Planters National Bank v. Hunters Horn Associates</i>, 158 B.R. 729 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1993); <i>In re Channel 64 Joint Venture</i>, 61 B.R. 255 (Bankr. S.D. Oh. 1986). Rule 1004(a) could be construed as requiring the consent of all of the general partners to the filing of a voluntary petition, even if fewer than all of the general partners would have the authority under applicable nonbankruptcy law to commence a bankruptcy case for the partnership. Since this is a matter of substantive law beyond the scope of these rules, Rule 1004(a) is deleted as is the designation of subdivision (b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is retitled to reflect that it applies only to involuntary petitions filed against partnerships.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 107. The administrative cost of installments in excess of four is disproportionate to the benefits conferred. Prolonging the period beyond 180 days after the commencement of the case causes undesirable delays in administration. Paragraph (2) accordingly continues the imposition of a maximum of four on the number of installments and retains the maximum period of installment payments allowable on an original application at 120 days. Only in extraordinary cases should it be necessary to give an applicant an extension beyond the four months. The requirement of paragraph (3) that filing fees be paid in full before the debtor may pay an attorney for services in connection with the case codifies the rule declared in <i>In re Latham</i>, 271 Fed. 538 (N.D.N.Y. 1921), and <i>In re Darr</i>, 232 Fed. 415 (N.D.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to delete the sentence requiring a disclosure that the debtor has not paid an attorney or other person in connection with the case. Inability to pay the filing fee in installments is one of the requirements for a fee waiver under the 2005 revisions to 28 U.S.C. § 1930(f). If the attorney payment prohibition were retained, payment of an attorney’s fee would render many debtors ineligible for installment payments and thus enhance their eligibility for the fee waiver. The deletion of this prohibition from the rule, which was not statutorily required, ensures that debtors who have the financial ability to pay the fee in installments will do so rather than request a waiver.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(3) is amended in conformance with the changes to subdivision (b)(1) to reflect the 2005 amendments. The change is meant to clarify that subdivision (b)(3) refers to payments made after the debtor has filed the bankruptcy case and after the debtor has received permission to pay the fee in installments.

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b4bfbc5-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is an adaptation of former Rules 108, 8–106, 10–108 and 11–11. As specified in the rule, it is applicable in all types of cases filed under the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> requires at least a list of creditors with their names and addresses to be filed with the petition. This list is needed for notice of the meeting of creditors (Rule 2002) and notice of the order for relief (§ 342 of the Code). The list will also serve to meet the requirements of § 521(1) of the Code. Subdivision (a) recognizes that it may be impossible to file the schedules required by § 521(1) and subdivision (b) of the rule at the time the petition is filed but in order for the case to proceed expeditiously and efficiently it is necessary that the clerk have the names and addresses of creditors. It should be noted that subdivision (d) of the rule requires a special list of the 20 largest unsecured creditors in chapter 9 and 11 cases. That list is for the purpose of selecting a committee of unsecured creditors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is derived from former Rule 11–11 and conforms with § 521. This subdivision indicates the forms to be used. The court may dispense with the filing of schedules and the statement of affairs pursuant to § 521.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (c) and (f)</i> specify the time periods for filing the papers required by the rule as well as the number of copies. The provisions dealing with an involuntary case are derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 108. Under the Code, a chapter 11 case may be commenced by an involuntary petition (§ 303(a)), whereas under the Act, a Chapter XI case could have been commenced only by a voluntary petition. A motion for an extension of time to file the schedules and statements is required to be made on notice to parties, as the court may direct, including a creditors’ committee if one has been appointed under § 1102 of the Code and a trustee or examiner if one has been appointed pursuant to § 1104 of the Code. Although written notice is preferable, it is not required by the rule; in proper circumstances the notice may be by telephone or otherwise.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is new and requires that a list of the 20 largest unsecured creditors, excluding insiders as defined in § 101(25) of the Code, be filed with the petition. The court, pursuant to § 1102 of the Code, is required to appoint a committee of unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after the order for relief. That committee generally is to consist of the seven largest unsecured creditors who are willing to serve. The list should, as indicated on Official Form No. 9, specify the nature and amount of the claim. It is important for the court to be aware of the different types of claims existing in the case and this form should supply such information.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> applies only in chapter 9 municipality cases. It gives greater discretion to the court to determine the time for filing a list of creditors and any other matter related to the list. A list of creditors must at some point be filed since one is required by § 924 of the Code. When the plan affects special assessments, the definitions in § 902(2) and (3) for “special tax payer” and “special tax payer affected by the plan” become relevant.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i> is derived from former Rules 108(c) and 11–11. Nondebtor general partners are liable to the partnership’s trustee for any deficiency in the partnership’s estate to pay creditors in full as provided by § 723 of the Code. Subdivision (g) authorizes the court to require a partner to file a statement of personal assets and liabilities to provide the trustee with the relevant information.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (h)</i> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 108(e) for chapter 7, 11 and 13 purposes. It implements the provisions in and language of § 541(a)(5) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (i) and (j)</i> are adapted from §§ 165 and 166 of the Act and former Rule 10–108(b) and (c) without change in substance. The term “party in interest” is not defined in the Code or the rules, but reference may be made to § 1109(b) of the Code. In the context of this subdivision, the term would include the debtor, the trustee, any indenture trustee, creditor, equity security holder or committee appointed pursuant to § 1102 of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (k)</i> is derived from former Rules 108(d) and 10–108(a).</p>

These documents are required by the 1984 amendments to § 521 of the Code. Official Form No. 6A is prescribed for use by an individual debtor for filing a schedule of current income and current expenditures in a chapter 7 or chapter 11 case. Although a partnership or corporation is also required by § 521(1) to file a schedule of current income and current expenditures, no Official Form is prescribed therefor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The time for filing the statement of intention is governed by § 521(2)(A). A copy of the statement of intention must be served on the trustee and the creditors named in the statement within the same time. The provisions of subdivision (c) governing the time for filing when a chapter 11 or chapter 13 case is converted to a chapter 7 case have been omitted from subdivision (c) as amended. Filing after conversion is now governed exclusively by Rule 1019.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i> has been abrogated. The number of copies of the documents required by this rule will be determined by local rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (h)</i> is amended to include a direct reference to § 541(a)(5).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (k)</i> provides that the court may not order an entity other than the debtor to prepare and file the statement of intention.</p>

The debtor in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case shall file the list, schedules and statements required in subdivisions (a)(1), (b)(1), and (h). It is expected that the information currently provided in the Chapter 13 Statement will be included in the schedules and statements as revised not later than the effective date of these rule amendments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c)</i> are amended to provide the United States trustee with notice of any motion to extend the time for the filing of any lists, schedules, or statements. Such notice enables the United States trustee to take appropriate steps to avoid undue delay in the administration of the case. See 28 U.S.C. § 586(a)(3)(G). Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c) are amended further to provide notice to committees elected under § 705 or appointed pursuant to § 1102 of the Code. Committees of retired employees appointed pursuant to § 1114 are not included.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The additions of references to unexpired leases in subdivisions (b)(1) and (g) indicate that the schedule requires the inclusion of unexpired leases as well as other executory contracts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The words “with the court” in subdivisions (b)(1), (e), and (g) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (l)</i>, which is derived from Rule X–1002(a), provides the United States trustee with the information required to perform certain administrative duties such as the appointment of a committee of unsecured creditors. In a chapter 7 case, the United States trustee should be aware of the debtor’s intention with respect to collateral that secures a consumer debt so that the United States trustee may monitor the progress of the case. Pursuant to § 307 of the Code, the United States trustee has standing to raise, appear and be heard on issues and the lists, schedules and statements contain information that, when provided to the United States trustee, enable that office to participate effectively in the case. The United States trustee has standing to move to dismiss a chapter 7 or 13 case for failure to file timely the list, schedules or statement required by § 521(1) of the Code. See §§ 707(a)(3) and 1307(c)(9). It is therefore necessary for the United States trustee to receive notice of any extension of time to file such documents. Upon request, the United States trustee also may receive from the trustee or debtor in possession a list of equity security holders.</p>

This amendment is in recognition of the 1991 amendments to the Official Forms that abrogated the Chapter 13 Statement and made the same forms for schedules and statements applicable in all cases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This subdivision also contains a technical correction. The phrase “superseded case” creates the erroneous impression that conversion of a case results in a new case that is distinct from the original case. The effect of conversion of a case is governed by § 348 of the Code.</p>

Requiring debtors to file the statement provides the court with an opportunity to make judicial disqualification determinations at the outset of the case. This could reduce problems later in the case by preventing the initial assignment of the case to a judge who holds a financial interest in a parent company of the debtor or some other entity that holds a significant ownership interest in the debtor. Moreover, by including the disclosure statement filing requirement at the commencement of the case, the debtor does not have to make the same disclosure filing each time it is involved in an adversary proceeding throughout the case. The debtor also must file supplemental statements as changes in ownership might arise.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</i>. No changes since publication.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">[<i>Subdivisions (c) and (f)</i>.] The rule is amended to add a requirement that a debtor submit a statement setting out the debtor’s social security number. The addition is necessary because of the corresponding amendment to Rule 1005 which now provides that the caption of the petition includes only the final four digits of the debtor’s social security number. The debtor submits the statement, but it is not filed, nor is it included in the case file. The statement provides the information necessary to include on the service copy of the notice required under Rule 2002(a)(1). It will also provide the information to facilitate the ability of creditors to search the court record by a search of a social security number already in the creditor’s possession.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</i>. The rule amendment is made in response to the extensive commentary that urged the Advisory Committee to continue the obligation contained in current Rule 1005 that a debtor must include his or her social security number on the caption of the bankruptcy petition. Rule 1005 is amended to limit that disclosure to the final four digits of the social security number, and Rule 1007 is amended to reinstate the obligation in a manner that will provide more protection of the debtor’s privacy while continuing access to the information to those persons with legitimate need for that data. The debtor must disclose the information, but the method of disclosure is by a verified statement that is submitted to the clerk. The statement is not filed in the case and does not become a part of the court record. Therefore, it enables the clerk to deliver that information to the creditors and the trustee in the case, but it does not become a part of the court record governed by § 107 of the Bankruptcy Code and is not available to the public.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b4bfbcb-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Notice to creditors and other parties in interest is essential to the operation of the bankruptcy system. Sending notice requires a convenient listing of the names and addresses of the entities to whom notice must be sent, and virtually all of the bankruptcy courts have adopted a local rule requiring the submission of a list of these entities with the petition and in a particular format. These lists are commonly called the “mailing matrix.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Given the universal adoption of these local rules, the need for such lists in all cases is apparent. Consequently, the rule is amended to require the debtor to submit such a list at the commencement of the case. This list may be amended when necessary. <i>See</i> Rule 1009(a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The content of the list is described by reference to Schedules D through H of the Official Forms rather than by reference to creditors or persons holding claims. The cross reference to the Schedules as the source of the names for inclusion in the list ensures that persons such as codebtors or nondebtor parties to executory contracts and unexpired leases will receive appropriate notices in the case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While this rule renders unnecessary, in part, local rules on the subject, this rule does not direct any particular format or form for the list to take. Local rules still may govern those particulars of the list.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is amended to reflect that subdivision (a)(1) no longer requires the debtor to file a schedule of liabilities with the petition in lieu of a list of creditors. The filing of the list is mandatory, and subdivision (b) of the rule requires the filing of schedules. Thus, subdivision (c) no longer needs to account for the possibility that the debtor can delay filing a schedule of liabilities when the petition is accompanied by a list of creditors. Subdivision (c) simply addresses the situation in which the debtor does not file schedules or statements with the petition, and the procedure for seeking an extension of time for filing.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) is amended to require that any foreign representative filing a petition for recognition to commence a case under chapter 15, which was added to the Code in 2005, file a list of entities with whom the debtor is engaged in litigation in the United States. The foreign representative filing the petition for recognition must also list any entities against whom provisional relief is being sought as well as all persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor. This should ensure that entities most interested in the case, or their representatives, will receive notice of the petition under Rule 2002(q).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(4) is amended to require the foreign representative who files a petition for recognition under chapter 15 to file the documents described in § 1515 of the Code as well as a corporate ownership statement. The subdivision is also amended to identify the foreign representative in language that more closely follows the text of the Code. Former subdivision (a)(4) is renumbered as subdivision (a)(5) and stylistic changes were made to the subdivision.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(1) addresses schedules, statements, and other documents that the debtor must file unless the court orders otherwise and other than in a case under chapter 9. This subdivision is amended to include documentary requirements added by the 2005 amendments to § 521 that apply to the same group of debtors and have the same time limits as the existing requirements of (b)(1). Consistent with the E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107–347, the payment advices should be redacted before they are filed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to conform to the renumbering of the subsections of § 521.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivisions (b)(3) through (b)(8) are new and implement the 2005 amendments to the Code. Subdivision (b)(3) provides for the filing of a document relating to the credit counseling requirement provided by the 2005 amendments to § 109 in the context of an Official Form that warns the debtor of the consequences of failing to comply with the credit counseling requirement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(4) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in § 101, for certain chapter 7 debtors and, if required, additional calculations of expenses required by the 2005 amendments to § 707(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(5) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in § 101, for individual chapter 11 debtors. The 2005 amendments to § 1129(a)(15) condition plan confirmation for individual debtors on the commitment of disposable income, as defined in § 1325(b)(2), which is based on current monthly income.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(6) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in § 101, for chapter 13 debtors and, if required, additional calculations of expenses. These changes are necessary because the 2005 amendments to § 1325 require that the determination of disposable income begin with current monthly income.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(7) reflects the 2005 amendments to §§ 727 and 1328 of the Code that condition the receipt of a discharge on the completion of a personal financial management course, with certain exceptions. Certain individual chapter 11 debtors may also be required to complete a personal financial management course under § 727(a)(11) as incorporated by § 1141(d)(3)(C). To evidence compliance with that requirement, the subdivision requires the debtor to file the appropriate Official Form certifying that the debtor has completed the personal financial management course.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(8) requires an individual debtor in a case under chapter 11, 12, or 13 to file a statement that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the restrictions on a homestead exemption as set out in § 522(q) of the Code are applicable. Sections 1141(d)(5)(C), 1228(f), and 1328(h) each provide that the court shall not enter a discharge order unless it finds that there is no reasonable cause to believe that § 522(q) applies. Requiring the debtor to submit a statement to that effect in cases under chapters 11, 12, and 13 in which an exemption is claimed in excess of the amount allowed under § 522(q)(1) provides the court with a basis to conclude, in the absence of any contrary information, that § 522(q) does not apply. Creditors receive notice under Rule 2002(f)(11) of the time to request postponement of the entry of the discharge to permit an opportunity to challenge the debtor’s assertions in the Rule 1007(b)(8) statement in appropriate cases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is amended to include time limits for the filing requirements added to subdivision (b) due to the 2005 amendments to the Code, and to make conforming amendments. Separate time limits are provided for the documentation of credit counseling and for the statement of the completion of the financial management course. While most documents relating to credit counseling must be filed with the voluntary petition, the credit counseling certificate and debt repayment plan can be filed within 15 days of the filing of a voluntary petition if the debtor files a statement under subdivision (b)(3)(B) with the petition. Sections 727(a)(11), 1141(d)(3), and 1328(g) of the Code require individual debtors to complete a personal financial management course prior to the entry of a discharge. The amendment allows the court to enlarge the deadline for the debtor to file the statement of completion. Because no party is harmed by the enlargement, no specific restriction is placed on the court’s discretion to enlarge the deadline, even after its expiration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) of the rule is also amended to recognize the limitation on the extension of time to file schedules and statements when the debtor is a small business debtor. Section 1116(3), added to the Code in 2005, establishes a specific standard for courts to apply in the event that the debtor in possession or the trustee seeks an extension for filing these forms for a period beyond 30 days after the order for relief.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. Subdivision (a)(4) was amended to insert the requirement that the foreign representative who files the chapter 15 petition must file the corporate ownership statement. Subdivision (b)(4) was amended to provide that all individual debtors rather than just those whose debts are primarily consumer debts must file the statement of current monthly income. Subdivisions (b)(7) and (c) were amended to make the obligation to file a statement of the completion of a personal financial management course applicable to certain individual chapter 11 debtors as well as to individual debtors in chapters 7 and 13. Subdivision (c) is also amended to provide the court with broad discretion to enlarge the time to file the statement of completion of a personal financial management course. The Committee Note was amended to explain these changes.</p>

As amended, subdivision (b)(5) of the rule includes an exception for subchapter V cases.

It does not deal with service of a summons and complaint instituting an adversary proceeding pursuant to Part VII.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While this rule is similar to former Bankruptcy Rule 111, it substitutes the clerk of the bankruptcy court for the clerk of the district court as the person who is to issue the summons.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The modes of service prescribed by the rule are personal or by mail, when service can be effected in one of these ways in the United States. Such service is to be made in the manner prescribed in adversary proceedings by Rule 7004(a) and (b). If service must be made in a foreign country, the mode of service is one of that set forth in Rule 4(i) F.R.Civ.P.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the methods set out in Rule 7004(a) and (b) cannot be utilized, service by publication coupled with mailing to the last known address is authorized. <i>Cf</i>. Rule 7004(c). The court determines the form and manner of publication as provided in Rule 9007. The publication need not set out the petition or the order directing service by publication. In order to apprise the debtor fairly, however, the publication should include all the information required to be in the summons by Official Form No. 13 and a notice indicating how service is being effected and how a copy of the petition may be obtained.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There are no territorial limits on the service authorized by this rule, which continues the practice under the former rules and Act. There must, however, be a basis for jurisdiction pursuant to § 109(a) of the Code for the court to order relief. Venue provisions are set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1472.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) of Rule 7004 and subdivisions (g) and (h) of Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. govern time and proof of service and amendment of process or of proof of service.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In 1996, the letter designation of subdivision (f) of Rule 7004 (Summons; Time Limit for Service) was changed to subdivision (e).

Under chapter 15, a foreign representative commences a case by filing a petition for recognition of a pending foreign nonmain proceeding. The amendment requires service of the summons and petition on the debtor and any entity against whom the representative is seeking provisional relief. Until the court enters a recognition order under § 1517, no stay is in effect unless the court enters some form of provisional relief under § 1519. Thus, only those entities against whom specific provisional relief is sought need to be served. The court may, however, direct that service be made on additional entities as appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule does not apply to a petition for recognition of a foreign main proceeding.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is also amended by renumbering the prior rule as subdivision (a) and adding a new subdivision (b) requiring any corporate creditor that files or joins an involuntary petition to file a corporate ownership statement.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b4e6c02-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 112. A petition filed by fewer than all the general partners under Rule 1004(b) to have an order for relief entered with respect to the partnership is referred to as a petition against the partnership because of the adversary character of the proceeding it commences. <i>Cf</i>. § 303(b)(3) of the Code; 2 Collier <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶ 303.05[5][a] (15th ed. 1981); 2 <i>id</i>. ¶¶ 18.33[2], 18.46 (14th ed. 1966). One who denies an allegation of membership in the firm is nevertheless recognized as a party entitled to contest a petition filed against a partnership under subdivision (b) of Rule 1004 in view of the possible consequences to him of an order for relief against the entity alleged to include him as a member. See § 723 of the Code; <i>Francis v. McNeal</i>, 228 U.S. 695 (1913); <i>Manson v. Williams</i>, 213 U.S. 453 (1909); <i>Carter v. Whisler</i>, 275 Fed. 743, 746–747 (8th Cir. 1921). The rule preserves the features of the former Act and Rule 112 and the Code permitting no response by creditors to an involuntary petition or petition against a partnership under Rule 1004(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b):</i> Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. has been looked to by the courts as prescribing the mode of making a defense or objection to a petition in bankruptcy. See <i>Fada of New York, Inc. v. Organization Service Co., Inc</i>., 125 F.2d 120. (2d Cir. 1942); <i>In the Matter of McDougald</i>, 17 F.R.D. 2, 5 (W.D. Ark. 1955); <i>In the Matter of Miller</i>, 6 Fed. Rules Serv. 12f.26, Case No. 1 (N.D. Ohio 1942); <i>Tatum v. Acadian Production Corp. of La</i>., 35 F. Supp. 40, 50 (E.D. La. 1940); 2 Collier, <i>supra</i> ¶ 303.07 (15th ed. 1981); 2 <i>id</i>. at 134–40 (14th ed. 1966). As pointed out in the Note accompanying former Bankruptcy Rule 915 an objection that a debtor is neither entitled to the benefits of the Code nor amenable to an involuntary petition goes to jurisdiction of the subject matter and may be made at any time consistent with Rule 12(h)(3) F.R.Civ.P. Nothing in this rule recognizes standing in a creditor or any other person not authorized to contest a petition to raise an objection that a person eligible to file a voluntary petition cannot be the subject of an order for relief on an involuntary petition. See Seligson &amp; King, <i>Jurisdiction and Venue in Bankruptcy</i>, 36 Ref.J. 36, 38–40 (1962).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As Collier has pointed out with respect to the Bankruptcy Act, “the mechanics of the provisions in § 18a and b relating to time for appearance and pleading are unnecessarily confusing. . . . It would seem, though, to be more straightforward to provide, as does Federal Rule 12(a), that the time to respond runs from the date of service rather than the date of issuance of process.” 2 Collier, <i>supra</i> at 119. The time normally allowed for the service and filing of an answer or motion under Rule 1011 runs from the date of the issuance of the summons. Compare Rule 7012. Service of the summons and petition will ordinarily be made by mail under Rule 1010 and must be made within 10 days of the issuance of the summons under Rule 7004(e), which governs the time of service. When service is made by publication, the court should fix the time for service and filing of the response in the light of all the circumstances so as to afford a fair opportunity to the debtor to enter a defense or objection without unduly delaying the hearing on the petition. <i>Cf</i>. Rule 12(a) F.R.Civ.P.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c):</i> Under subdivision (c), the timely service of a motion permitted by Rule 12(b), (e), (f), or (h) F.R.Civ.P. alters the time within which an answer must be filed. If the court denies a motion or postpones its disposition until trial on the merits, the answer must be served within 10 days after notice of the court’s action. If the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the answer may be served any time within 10 days after the service of the more definite statement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Many of the rules governing adversary proceedings apply to proceedings on a contested petition unless the court otherwise directs as provided in Rule 1018. The specific provisions of this Rule 1011 or 7005, however, govern the filing of an answer or motion responsive to a petition. The rules of Part VII are adaptations of the corresponding Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the effect of Rule 1018 is thus to make the provisions of Civil Rules 5, 8, 9, 15, and 56, <i>inter alia</i>, generally applicable to the making of defenses and objections to the petition. Rule 1018 follows prior law and practice in this respect. See 2 Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶¶ 18.39–18.41 (14th ed. 1966).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. This subdivision adopts the position taken in many cases that an affirmative judgment against a petitioning creditor cannot be sought by a counterclaim filed in an answer to an involuntary petition. See, <i>e.g., Georgia Jewelers, Inc. v. Bulova Watch Co</i>., 302 F.2d 362, 369–70 (5th Cir. 1962); <i>Associated Electronic Supply Co. of Omaha v. C.B.S. Electronic Sales Corp</i>., 288 F.2d 683, 684–85 (8th Cir. 1961). The subdivision follows <i>Harris v. Capehart-Farnsworth Corp</i>., 225 F.2d 268 (8th Cir. 1955), in permitting the debtor to challenge the standing of a petitioner by filing a counterclaim against him. It does not foreclose the court from rejecting a counterclaim that cannot be determined without unduly delaying the decision upon the petition. See <i>In the Matter of Bichel Optical Laboratories, Inc</i>., 299 F. Supp. 545 (D. Minn. 1969).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. This subdivision makes it clear that no reply needs to be made to an answer, including one asserting a counterclaim, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b50b61e-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116 which contained venue as well as transfer provisions. <ref href="/us/pl/95/598">Public Law 95–598</ref>, however, placed the venue provisions in 28 U.S.C. § 1472, and no purpose is served by repeating them in this rule. Transfer of cases is provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1475 but this rule adds the procedure for obtaining transfer. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1472, proper venue for cases filed under the Code is either the district of domicile, residence, principal place of business, or location of principal assets for 180 days or the longer portion thereof immediately preceding the petition. 28 U.S.C. § 1475 permits the court to transfer a case in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties. If the venue is improper, the court may retain or transfer the case in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1477.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> of the rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116(b). It implements 28 U.S.C. §§ 1475 and 1477 and clarifies the procedure to be followed in requesting and effecting transfer of a case. Subdivision (a) protects the parties against being subjected to a transfer except on a timely motion of a party in interest. If the transfer would result in fragmentation or duplication of administration, increase expense, or delay closing the estate, such a factor would bear on the timeliness of the motion as well as on the propriety of the transfer under the standards prescribed in subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) of the rule requires the interest of justice and the convenience of the parties to be the grounds of any transfer of a case or of the retention of a case filed in an improper district as does 28 U.S.C. § 1477. <i>Cf</i>. 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) (district court may transfer any civil action “[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice”). It also expressly requires a hearing on notice to the petitioner or petitioners before the transfer of any case may be ordered. Under this rule, a motion by a party in interest is necessary. There is no provision for the court to act on its own initiative.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116(c). It authorizes the court in which the first petition is filed under the Code by or against a debtor to entertain a motion seeking a determination whether the case so commenced should continue or be transferred and consolidated or administered jointly with another case commenced by or against the same or related person in another court under a different chapter of the Code. Subdivision (b) is correlated with 28 U.S.C. § 1472 which authorizes petitioners to file cases involving a partnership and partners or affiliated debtors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reference in subdivision (b) to petitions filed “by” a partner or “by” any other of the persons mentioned is to be understood as referring to voluntary petitions. It is not the purpose of this subdivision to permit more than one case to be filed in the same court because a creditor signing an involuntary petition happens to be a partner, a partnership, or an affiliate of a debtor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Transfers of adversary proceedings in cases under title 11 are governed by Rule 7087 and 28 U.S.C. § 1475.</p>

Formerly, 28 U.S.C. § 1477 authorized a court either to transfer or retain a case which had been commenced in a district where venue was improper. However, 28 U.S.C. § 1412, which supersedes 28 U.S.C. § 1477, authorizes only the transfer of a case. The rule is amended to delete the reference to retention of a case commenced in the improper district. Dismissal of a case commenced in the improper district as authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 1406 has been added to the rule. If a timely motion to dismiss for improper venue is not filed, the right to object to venue is waived.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The last sentence of the rule has been deleted as unnecessary.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The other amendments to this rule are consistent with the responsibilities of the United States trustee in the supervision and administration of cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 586(a)(3).

Subdivision (b) is amended to clarify when proceedings in the subsequently filed cases are stayed. It requires an order of the court in which the first-filed petition is pending to stay proceedings in the related cases.

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b50b634-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 117(a). It applies to cases when the same debtor is named in both voluntary and involuntary petitions, when husband and wife have filed a joint petition pursuant to § 302 of the Code, and when two or more involuntary petitions are filed against the same debtor. It also applies when cases are pending in the same court by virtue of a transfer of one or more petitions from another court. Subdivision (c) allows the court discretion regarding the order of trial of issues raised by two or more involuntary petitions against the same debtor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> recognizes the propriety of joint administration of estates in certain kinds of cases. The election or appointment of one trustee for two or more jointly administered estates is authorized by Rule 2009. The authority of the court to order joint administration under subdivision (b) extends equally to the situation when the petitions are filed under different sections, <i>e.g</i>., when one petition is voluntary and the other involuntary, and when all of the petitions are filed under the same section of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Consolidation of cases implies a unitary administration of the estate and will ordinarily be indicated under the circumstances to which subdivision (a) applies. This rule does not deal with the consolidation of cases involving two or more separate debtors. Consolidation of the estates of separate debtors may sometimes be appropriate, as when the affairs of an individual and a corporation owned or controlled by that individual are so intermingled that the court cannot separate their assets and liabilities. Consolidation, as distinguished from joint administration, is neither authorized nor prohibited by this rule since the propriety of consolidation depends on substantive considerations and affects the substantive rights of the creditors of the different estates. For illustrations of the substantive consolidation of separate estates, see <i>Sampsell v. Imperial Paper &amp; Color Corp</i>., 313 U.S. 215 (1941). See also <i>Chemical Bank N.Y. Trust Co. v. Kheel</i>, 369 F.2d 845 (2d Cir. 1966); Seligson &amp; Mandell, <i>Multi-Debtor Petition—Consolidation of Debtors and Due Process of Law</i>, 73 Com.L.J. 341 (1968); Kennedy, <i>Insolvency and the Corporate Veil in the United States</i> in <i>Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Comparative Law</i> 232, 248–55 (1971).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Joint administration as distinguished from consolidation may include combining the estates by using a single docket for the matters occurring in the administration, including the listing of filed claims, the combining of notices to creditors of the different estates, and the joint handling of other purely administrative matters that may aid in expediting the cases and rendering the process less costly.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> is an adaptation of the provisions of Rule 42(a) F.R.Civ.P. for the purposes of administration of estates under this rule. The rule does not deal with filing fees when an order for the consolidation of cases or joint administration of estates is made.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A joint petition of husband and wife, requiring the payment of a single filing fee, is permitted by § 302 of the Code. Consolidation of such a case, however, rests in the discretion of the court; see § 302(b) of the Code.</p>

While the rule applies to voluntary and involuntary cases, the “consent of the parties” referred to is that of petitioning creditors and the debtor in an involuntary case. The last sentence recognizes that the court should not be confined to petitioning creditors in its choice of parties on whom to call for assistance in preparing the list of creditors when the debtor fails to do so. This subdivision implements §§ 303(j), 707, 1112 and 1307 of the Code by specifying the manner of and persons to whom notice shall be given and requiring the court to hold a hearing on the issue of dismissal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 120(b). A dismissal under this subdivision can occur only when the petition has been permitted to be filed pursuant to Rule 1006(b). The provision for notice in paragraph (3) is correlated with the provision in Rule 4006 when there is a waiver, denial, or revocation of a discharge. As pointed out in the Note accompanying Rule 4008, the purpose of notifying creditors of a debtor that no discharge has been granted is to correct their assumption to the contrary so that they can take appropriate steps to protect their claims.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> is new and specifies the notice required for a hearing on dismissal or suspension pursuant to § 305 of the Code. The suspension to which this subdivision refers is that of the case; it does not concern abstention of the court in hearing an adversary proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1478(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. Any proceeding, whether by a debtor or other party, to dismiss or convert a case under §§ 706, 707, 1112, or 1307 is commenced by a motion pursuant to Rule 9014.</p>

Conversion or dismissal under these sections is initiated by the filing and serving of a motion as required by Rule 9013. No hearing is required on these motions unless the court directs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case as authorized by § 1307(a) is accomplished by the filing of a notice of conversion. The notice of conversion procedure is modeled on the voluntary dismissal provision of Rule 41(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. Conversion occurs on the filing of the notice. No court order is required.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> is new and provides the procedure to be followed when a court on its own motion has made a preliminary determination that an individual debtor’s chapter 7 case may be dismissed pursuant to § 707(b) of the Code, which was added by the 1984 amendments. A debtor’s failure to attend the hearing is not a ground for dismissal pursuant to § 707(b).</p>

The United States trustee receives the notice pursuant to Rule 2002(k).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The word “petition” is changed to “case” in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) to conform to §§ 707, 930, 1112, 1208, and 1307.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is amended to conform to § 348(c) of the Code which refers to the “conversion order.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (a) and (d)</i> are amended to provide procedures for dismissal or conversion of a chapter 12 case. Procedures for dismissal or conversion under § 1208(a) and (b) are the same as the procedures for dismissal or conversion of a chapter 13 case under § 1307(a) and (b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment to § 707(b) of the Code which permits the United States trustee to make a motion to dismiss a case for substantial abuse. The time limit for such a motion is added by this subdivision. In general, the facts that are the basis for a motion to dismiss under § 707(b) exist at the time the case is commenced and usually can be discovered early in the case by reviewing the debtor’s schedules and examining the debtor at the meeting of creditors. Since dismissal for substantial abuse has the effect of denying the debtor a discharge in the chapter 7 case based on matters which may be discovered early, a motion to dismiss under § 707(b) is analogous to an objection to discharge pursuant to Rule 4004 and, therefore, should be required to be made within a specified time period. If matters relating to substantial abuse are not discovered within the time period specified in subdivision (e) because of the debtor’s false testimony, refusal to obey a court order, fraudulent schedules or other fraud, and the debtor receives a discharge, the debtor’s conduct may constitute the basis for revocation of the discharge under § 727(d) and (e) of the Code.</p>

Rule 2002(f) provides for notice to creditors of the dismissal of a case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 2002(a) and this rule currently require notice to all creditors of a hearing on dismissal of a voluntary chapter 7 case for the debtor’s failure to file a list of creditors, schedules, and statement of financial affairs within the time provided in § 707(a)(3) of the Code. A new subdivision (c) is added to provide that the United States trustee, who is the only entity with standing to file a motion to dismiss under § 707(a)(3) or § 1307(c)(9), is required to serve the motion on only the debtor, the trustee, and any other entities as the court directs. This amendment, and the amendment to Rule 2002, will have the effect of avoiding the expense of sending notices of the motion to all creditors in a chapter 7 case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">New subdivision (f) is the same as current subdivision (d), except that it provides that a motion to suspend all proceedings in a case or to dismiss a case for substantial abuse of chapter 7 under § 707(b) is governed by Rule 9014.</p>

These statutory amendments permit conversion of a chapter 7 case to a case under chapter 11 or 13, change the basis for dismissal or conversion from “substantial abuse” to “abuse,” authorize parties other than the United States trustee to bring motions under § 707(b) under certain circumstances, and add § 707(c) to create an explicit ground for dismissal based on the request of a victim of a crime of violence or drug trafficking. The conforming amendments to subdivision (e) preserve the time limits already in place for § 707(b) motions, except to the extent that § 704(b)(2) sets the deadline for the United States trustee to act. In contrast to the grounds for a motion to dismiss under § 707(b)(2), which are quite specific, the grounds under § 707(b)(1) and (3) are very general. Therefore, to enable the debtor to respond, subdivision (e) requires that motions to dismiss under § 707(b)(1) and (3) state with particularity the circumstances alleged to constitute abuse.</p>

See the Note accompanying Rule 7001 <i>infra</i>. Because of the special need for dispatch and expedition in the determination of the issues in an involuntary petition, see <i>Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co</i>., 222 U.S. 300, 309 (1911), the objective of some of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and their adaptations in Part VII to facilitate the settlement of multiple controversies involving many persons in a single lawsuit is not compatible with the exigencies of bankruptcy administration. See <i>United States F. &amp; G. Co. v. Bray</i>, 225 U.S. 205, 218 (1912). For that reason Rules 7013, 7014 and 7018–7023 will rarely be appropriate in a proceeding on a contested petition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Certain terms used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have altered meanings when they are made applicable in cases under the Code by these rules. See Rule 9002 <i>infra</i>. This Rule 1018 requires that the terms “adversary proceedings” when used in the rules in Part VII and “complaint” when used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure be given altered meanings when they are made applicable to proceedings relating to a contested petition or proceedings to vacate any order for relief. A motion to vacate an order for relief, whether or not made on a petition that was or could have been contested, is governed by the rules in Part VII referred to in this Rule 1018.</p>

This provision was formerly included in Rule 1003(e)(4).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although this rule does not contain an explicit authorization for the entry of an order for relief when a debtor refuses to cooperate in discovery relating to a contested involuntary petition, the court has ample power under Rule 37(b) F.R.Civ.P., as incorporated by Rule 7037, to enter an order for relief under appropriate circumstances. Rule 37(b) authorizes the court to enter judgment by default or an order that “facts shall be taken as established.”</p>

As to chapter 15 cases, the rule applies to contests over the petition for recognition and not to all matters that arise in the case. Thus, proceedings governed by § 1519(e) and § 1521(e) of the Code must comply with Rules 7001(7) and 7065, which provide that actions for injunctive relief are adversary proceedings governed by Part VII of the rules. The rule is also amended to clarify that it applies to contests over an involuntary petition, and not to matters merely “relating to” a contested involuntary petition. Matters that may arise in a chapter 15 case or an involuntary case, other than contests over the petition itself, are governed by the otherwise applicable rules.</p>

<notes type="uscNote" id="id1b53278d-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba">
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b53278e-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 122 and implements § 348 of the Code. The rule applies to proceedings in a chapter 7 case following supersession of a case commenced under chapter 11 or 13, whether the latter was initiated by an original petition or was converted from a pending chapter 7 or another chapter case. The rule is not intended to invalidate any action taken in the superseded case before its conversion to chapter 7.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (1):</i> If requirements applicable in the superseded case respecting the filing of schedules of debts and property, or lists of creditors and inventory, and of statements of financial affairs have been complied with before the order directing conversion to liquidation, these documents will ordinarily provide all the information about the debts, property, financial affairs, and contracts of the debtor needed for the administration of the estate. If the information submitted in the superseded case is inadequate for the purposes of administration, however, the court may direct the preparation of further informational material and the manner and time of its submission pursuant to paragraph (1). If no schedules, lists, inventories, or statements were filed in the superseded case, this paragraph imposes the duty on the debtor to file schedules and a statement of affairs pursuant to Rule 1007 as if an involuntary petition had been filed on the date when the court directed the conversion of the case to a liquidation case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraphs (2) and (3)</i>. Paragraph (2) requires notice to be given to all creditors of the order of conversion. The notice is to be included in the notice of the meeting of creditors and Official Form No. 16 may be adapted for use. A meeting of creditors may have been held in the superseded case as required by § 341(a) of the Code but that would not dispense with the need to hold one in the ensuing liquidation case. Section 701(a) of the Code permits the court to appoint the trustee acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case as interim trustee in the chapter 7 case. Section 702(a) of the Code allows creditors to elect a trustee but only at the meeting of creditors held under § 341. The right to elect a trustee is not lost because the chapter 7 case follows a chapter 11 or 13 case. Thus a meeting of creditors is necessary. The date fixed for the meeting of creditors will control at least the time for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c). That time will remain applicable in the ensuing chapter 7 case except as paragraph (3) provides, if that time had expired in an earlier chapter 7 case which was converted to the chapter 11 or 13 case, it is not revived in the subsequent chapter 7 case. The same is true if the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge or to determine nondischargeability of a debt had expired. Paragraph (3), however, recognizes that such time may be extended by the court under Rule 4004 or 4007 on motion made within the original prescribed time.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (4)</i> renders it unnecessary to file anew claims that had been filed in the chapter 11 or 13 case before conversion to chapter 7.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (5)</i> contemplates that typically, after the court orders conversion of a chapter case to liquidation, a trustee under chapter 7 will forthwith take charge of the property of the estate and proceed expeditiously to liquidate it. The court may appoint the interim trustee in the chapter 7 case pursuant to § 701(a) of the Code. If creditors do not elect a trustee under § 702, the interim trustee becomes the trustee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (6)</i> requires the trustee or debtor in possession acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case to file a final report and schedule of debts incurred in that case. This schedule will provide the information necessary for giving the notice required by paragraph (7) of the rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (7)</i> requires that claims that arose in the chapter 11 or 13 case be filed within 60 days after entry of the order converting the case to one under chapter 7. Claims not scheduled pursuant to paragraph (6) of the rule or arising from the rejection of an executory contract entered into during the chapter case may be filed within a time fixed by the court. Pursuant to § 348(c) of the Code, the conversion order is treated as the order for relief to fix the time for the trustee to assume or reject executory contracts under § 365(d).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (8)</i> permits the extension of the time for filing claims when claims are not timely filed but only with respect to any surplus that may remain in the estate. See also § 726(a)(2)(C) and (3) of the Code.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b53278f-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (1)</i> is amended to provide for the filing of a statement of intention in a case converted to chapter 7. Paragraph (1)(B) is added to provide for the filing of the statement of intention when a case is converted to chapter 7. The time for filing the statement of intention and for an extension of that time is governed by § 521(2)(A) of the Code. An extension of time for other required filings is governed by Rule 1007(c), which paragraph (1)(A) incorporates by reference. Because of the amendment to Rule 1007(c), the filing of new lists, schedules, and statements is now governed exclusively by Rule 1019(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (3)</i> of the rule is expanded to include the effect of conversion of a chapter 11 or 13 case to a chapter 7 case. On conversion of a case from chapter 11 or 13 to a chapter 7 case, parties have a new period within which to file claims or complaints relating to the granting of the discharge or the dischargeability of a debt. This amendment is consistent with the holding and reasoning of the court in <i>F &amp; M Marquette Nat’l Bank v. Richards</i>, 780 F.2d 24 (8th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (4)</i> is amended to deal directly with the status of claims which are properly listed on the schedules filed in a chapter 11 case and deemed filed pursuant to § 1111(a) of the Code. Section 1111(a) is only applicable to the chapter 11 case. On conversion of the chapter 11 case to a chapter 7 case, paragraph (4) governs the status of claims filed in the chapter 11 case. The Third Circuit properly construed paragraph (4) as applicable to claims deemed filed in the superseded chapter 11 case. <i>In re Crouthamel Potato Chip Co</i>., 786 F.2d 141 (3d Cir. 1986).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendment to paragraph (4) changes that result by providing that only claims that are actually filed in the chapter 11 case are treated as filed in the superseding chapter 7 case. When chapter 11 cases are converted to chapter 7 cases, difficulties in obtaining and verifying the debtors’ records are common. It is unfair to the chapter 7 trustee and creditors to require that they be bound by schedules which may not be subject to verification.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (6)</i> is amended to place the obligation on the chapter 13 debtor to file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred during the superseded chapter 13 case.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b532790-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is amended to include conversion of a case from chapter 12 to chapter 7 and to implement the United States trustee system.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendments to paragraph (1)(A) are stylistic. Reference to the statement of executory contracts is deleted to conform to the amendment to Rule 1007(b)(1) which changes the statement to a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (1)(B)</i> is amended to enable the United States trustee to monitor the progress of the case and to take appropriate action to enforce the debtor’s obligation to perform the statement of intention in a timely manner.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (2)</i> is deleted because notice of conversion of the case is required by Rules 1017(d), 2002(f)(2), and 9022. The United States trustee, who supervises trustees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 586(a), may give notice of the conversion to the trustee in the superseded case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (6)</i>, renumbered as paragraph (5), is amended to reduce to 15 days the time for filing a schedule of postpetition debts and requires inclusion of the name and address of each creditor in connection with the postpetition debt. These changes will enable the clerk to send postpetition creditors a timely notice of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to § 341(a) of the Code. The amendments to this paragraph also provide the United States trustee with the final report and account of the superseded case, and with a copy of every schedule filed after conversion of the case. Conversion to chapter 7 terminates the service of the trustee in the superseded case pursuant to § 348(e) of the Code. Sections 704(a)(9), 1106(a)(1), 1107(a), 1202(b)(1), 1203 and 1302(b)(1) of the Code require the trustee or debtor in possession to file a final report and account with the court and the United States trustee. The words “with the court” are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Paragraph (7)</i>, renumbered as paragraph (6), is amended to conform the time for filing postpetition claims to the time for filing prepetition claims pursuant to paragraph (3) (renumbered as paragraph (2)) of this rule and Rule 3002(c). This paragraph is also amended to eliminate the need for a court order to provide notice of the time for filing claims. It is anticipated that this notice will be given together with the notice of the meeting of creditors. It is amended further to avoid the need to fix a time for filing claims arising under § 365(d) if it is a no asset case upon conversion. If assets become available for distribution, the court may fix a time for filing such claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(4).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The additions of references to unexpired leases in paragraph (1)(A) and in paragraphs (6) and (7) (renumbered as paragraphs (5) and (6)) are technical amendments to clarify that unexpired leases are included as well as other executory contracts.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (6)</i> is amended to provide that a holder of an administrative expense claim incurred after the commencement of the case, but before conversion to chapter 7, is required to file a request for payment under § 503(a) within a time fixed by the court, rather than a proof of claim under § 501 and Rules 3001(a)–(d) and 3002. The 180-day period applicable to governmental units is intended to conform to § 502(b)(9) of the Code and Rule 3002(c)(1). It is unnecessary for the court to fix a time for filing requests for payment if it appears that there are not sufficient assets to pay preconversion administrative expenses. If a time for filing a request for payment of an administrative expense is fixed by the court, it may be enlarged as provided in Rule 9006(b). If an administrative expense claimant fails to timely file the request, it may be tardily filed under § 503(a) if permitted by the court for cause.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The final sentence of Rule 1019(6) is deleted because it is unnecessary in view of the other amendments to this paragraph. If a party has entered into a postpetition contract or lease with the trustee or debtor that constitutes an administrative expense, a timely request for payment must be filed in accordance with this paragraph and § 503(b) of the Code. The time for filing a proof of claim in connection with the rejection of any other executory contract or unexpired lease is governed by Rule 3002(c)(4).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The phrase “including the United States, any state, or any subdivision thereof” is deleted as unnecessary. Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>GAP Report on Rule 1019</i>. The proposed amendments to Rule 1019(6) were changed to delete the deadline for filing requests for payment of preconversion administrative expenses that would be applicable in all cases, and to provide instead that the court may fix such a deadline.

Therefore, the election provisions in the rule are eliminated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The 2005 amendments to the Code include several provisions relating to small business cases under chapter 11. Section 101 includes definitions of “small business debtor” and “small business case.” The purpose of the new language in this rule is to provide a procedure for informing the parties, the United States trustee, and the court of whether the debtor is a small business debtor, and to provide procedures for resolving disputes regarding the proper characterization of the debtor. Because it is important to resolve such disputes early in the case, a time limit for objecting to the debtor’s self-designation is imposed. Rule 9006(b)(1), which governs enlargement of time, is applicable to the time limits set forth in this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">An important factor in determining whether the debtor is a small business debtor is whether the United States trustee has appointed a committee of unsecured creditors under § 1102, and whether such a committee is sufficiently active and representative. Subdivision (c), relating to the appointment and activity of a committee of unsecured creditors, is designed to be consistent with the Code’s definition of “small business debtor.”</p>

L. No. 116–54, <ref href="/us/stat/133/1079">133 Stat. 1079</ref>. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor under subchapter V of chapter 11. The title and subdivision (a) of the rule are amended to include that option and to require a small business debtor to state in its voluntary petition, or in a statement filed within 14 days after the order for relief is entered in an involuntary case, whether it elects to proceed under subchapter V. The rule does not address whether the court, on a case-by-case basis, may allow a debtor to make an election to proceed under subchapter V after the times specified in subdivision (a) or, if it can, under what conditions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Former subdivision (c) of the rule is deleted because the existence or level of activity of a creditors’ committee is no longer a criterion for small-business-debtor status. The SBRA eliminated that portion of the definition of “small business debtor” in § 101(51D) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Former subdivision (d) is redesignated as subdivision (c), and the list of entities to be served is revised to reflect that in most small business and subchapter V cases there will not be a committee of creditors.</p>

In conformity with title 11 of the United States Code, this rule substitutes “interim trustee” for “receiver.” Subdivision (a) and (e) of Rule 201 are not included because the provisions contained therein are found in detail in § 303(g) of the Code, or they are inconsistent with § 701 of the Code.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> requires that the order specify which duties enumerated in § 303(g) shall be performed by the interim trustee.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> requires turnover of records and property to the trustee selected under § 702 of the Code, after qualification.

For example, the court may order the trustee or debtor in possession to transmit one or more of the notices required by this rule, such as, notice of a proposed sale of property. See § 363(b) of the Code. When publication of notices is required or desirable, reference should be made to Rule 9008.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Notice of the order for relief is required to be given by § 342 of the Code and by subdivision (f)(1) of this rule. That notice may be combined with the notice of the meeting of creditors as indicated in Official Form No. 16, the notice and order of the meeting of creditors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> sets forth the requirement that 20 days notice be given of the significant events in a case under the Bankruptcy Code. The former Act and Rules provided a ten day notice in bankruptcy and Chapter XI cases, and a 20 day notice in a Chapter X case. This rule generally makes uniform the 20 day notice provision except that subdivision (b) contains a 25 day period for certain events in a chapter 9, 11, or 13 case. Generally, Rule 9006 permits reduction of time periods. Since notice by mail is complete on mailing, the requirement of subdivision (a) is satisfied if the notices are deposited in the mail at least 20 days before the event. See Rule 9006(e). The exceptions referred to in the introductory phrase include the modifications in the notice procedure permitted by subdivision (h) as to non-filing creditors, subdivision (i) as to cases where a committee is functioning, and subdivision (k) where compliance with subdivision (a) is impracticable.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The notice of a proposed sale affords creditors an opportunity to object to the sale and raise a dispute for the court’s attention. Section 363(b) of the Code permits the trustee or debtor in possession to sell property, other than in the ordinary course of business, only after notice and hearing. If no objection is raised after notice, § 102(1) provides that there need not be an actual hearing. Thus, absent objection, there would be no court involvement with respect to a trustee’s sale. Once an objection is raised, only the court may pass on it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Prior to the Code the court could shorten the notice period for a proposed sale of property or dispense with notice. This subdivision (a), permits the 20 day period to be shortened in appropriate circumstances but the rule does not contain a provision allowing the court to dispense with notice. The rule is thus consistent with the Code, §§ 363(b) and 102(1)(A) of the Code. See 28 U.S.C. § 2075. It may be necessary, in certain circumstances, however, to use a method of notice other than mail. Subdivision (a)(2) vests the court with discretion, on cause shown, to order a different method. Reference should also be made to Rule 6004 which allows a different type of notice of proposed sales when the property is of little value.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Notice of the hearing on an application for compensation or reimbursement of expenses totalling $100 or less need not be given. In chapter 13 cases relatively small amounts are sometimes allowed for post-confirmation services and it would not serve a useful purpose to require advance notice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is similar to subdivision (a) but lengthens the notice time to 25 days with respect to those events particularly significant in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases. The additional time may be necessary to formulate objections to a disclosure statement or confirmation of a plan and preparation for the hearing on approval of the disclosure statement or confirmation. The disclosure statement and hearing thereon is only applicable in chapter 9 cases (§ 901(a) of the Code), and chapter 11 cases (§ 1125 of the Code).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> specifies certain matters that should be included in the notice of a proposed sale of property and notice of the hearing on an application for allowances. Rule 6004 fixes the time within which parties in interest may file objections to a proposed sale of property.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> relates exclusively to the notices given to equity security holders in chapter 11 cases. Under chapter 11, a plan may impair the interests of the debtor’s shareholders or a plan may be a relatively simple restructuring of unsecured debt. In some cases, it is necessary that equity interest holders receive various notices and in other cases there is no purpose to be served. This subdivision indicates that the court is not mandated to order notices but rather that the matter should be treated with some flexibility. The court may decide whether notice is to be given and how it is to be given. Under § 341(b) of the Code, a meeting of equity security holders is not required in each case, only when it is ordered by the court. Thus subdivision (d)(2) requires notice only when the court orders a meeting.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to the notices specified in this subdivision, there may be other events or matters arising in a case as to which equity security holders should receive notice. These are situations left to determination by the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>, authorizing a notice of the apparent insufficiency of assets for the payment of any dividend, is correlated with Rule 3002(c)(5), which provides for the issuance of an additional notice to creditors if the possibility of a payment later materializes.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i> provides for the transmission of other notices to which no time period applies. Clause (1) requires notice of the order for relief; this complements the mandate of § 342 of the Code requiring such notice as is appropriate of the order for relief. This notice may be combined with the notice of the meeting of creditors to avoid the necessity of more than one mailing. See Official Form No. 16, notice of meeting of creditors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i> recognizes that an agent authorized to receive notices for a creditor may, without a court order, designate where notices to the creditor he represents should be addressed. Agent includes an officer of a corporation, an attorney at law, or an attorney in fact if the requisite authority has been given him. It should be noted that Official Forms Nos. 17 and 18 do not include an authorization of the holder of a power of attorney to receive notices for the creditor. Neither these forms nor this rule carries any implication that such an authorization may not be given in a power of attorney or that a request for notices to be addressed to both the creditor or his duly authorized agent may not be filed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (h)</i>. After the time for filing claims has expired in a chapter 7 case, creditors who have not filed their claims in accordance with Rule 3002(c) are not entitled to share in the estate except as they may come within the special provisions of § 726 of the Code or Rule 3002(c)(6). The elimination of notice to creditors who have no recognized stake in the estate may permit economies in time and expense. Reduction of the list of creditors to receive notices under this subdivision is dis­cretionary. This subdivision does not apply to the notice of the meeting of creditors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (i)</i> contains a list of matters of which notice may be given a creditors’ committee or to its authorized agent in lieu of notice to the creditors. Such notice may serve every practical purpose of a notice to all the creditors and save delay and expense. <i>In re Schulte-United, Inc</i>., 59 F.2d 553, 561 (8th Cir. 1932).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (j)</i>. The premise for the requirement that the district director of internal revenue receive copies of notices that all creditors receive in a chapter 11 case is that every debtor is potentially a tax debtor of the United States. Notice to the district director alerts him to the possibility that a tax debtor’s estate is about to be liquidated or reorganized and that the debtor may be discharged. When other indebtedness to the United States is indicated, the United States attorney is notified as the person in the best position to protect the interests of the government. In addition, the provision requires notice by mail to the head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States through whose action the debtor became indebted to the United States. This rule is not intended to preclude a local rule from requiring a state or local tax authority to receive some or all of the notices to creditors under these rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (k)</i> specifies two kinds of situations in which notice by publication may be appropriate: (1) when notice by mail is impracticable; and (2) when notice by mail alone is less than adequate. Notice by mail may be impracticable when, for example, the debtor has disappeared or his records have been destroyed and the names and addresses of his creditors are unavailable, or when the number of creditors with nominal claims is very large and the estate to be distributed may be insufficient to defray the costs of issuing the notices. Supplementing notice by mail is also indicated when the debtor’s records are incomplete or inaccurate and it is reasonable to believe that publication may reach some of the creditors who would otherwise be missed. Rule 9008 applies when the court directs notice by publication under this rule. Neither clause (2) of subdivision (a) nor subdivision (k) of this rule is concerned with the publication of advertisement to the general public of a sale of property of the estate at public auction under Rule 6004(b). See 3 Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> 522–23 (14th ed. 1971); 4B <i>id</i>. 1165–67 (1967); 2 <i>id</i>. ¶ 363.03 (15th ed. 1981).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (m)</i>. Inclusion in notices to creditors of information as to other names used by the debtor as required by Rule 1005 will assist them in the preparation of their proofs of claim and in deciding whether to file a complaint objecting to the debtor’s discharge. Additional names may be listed by the debtor on his statement of affairs when he did not file the petition. The mailing of notices should not be postponed to await a delayed filing of the statement of financial affairs.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. A new notice requirement is added as clause (3). When a proposed sale is of all or substantially all of the debtor’s assets, it is appropriate that equity security holders be given notice of the proposed sale. The clauses of subdivision (d) are renumbered to accommodate this addition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i>. Clause (7) is eliminated. Mailing of a copy of the discharge order is governed by Rule 4004(g).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i> is amended to relieve the clerk of the duty to mail notices to the address shown in a proof of claim when a notice of no dividend has been given pursuant to Rule 2002. This amendment avoids the necessity of the clerk searching proofs of claim which are filed in no dividend cases to ascertain whether a different address is shown.</p>

Notice requirements relating to approval of such agreements are governed by Rule 4001(d).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(5)</i> is amended to include a hearing on dismissal or conversion of a chapter 12 case. This subdivision does not apply when a hearing is not required. It is also amended to avoid the necessity of giving notice to all creditors of a hearing on the dismissal of a consumer debtor’s case based on substantial abuse of chapter 7. Such hearings on dismissal under § 707(b) of the Code are governed by Rule 1017(e).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(9)</i> is added to provide for notice of the time fixed for filing objections and the hearing to consider confirmation of a plan in a chapter 12 case. Section 1224 of the Code requires “expedited notice” of the confirmation hearing in a chapter 12 case and requires that the hearing be concluded not later than 45 days after the filing of the plan unless the time is extended for cause. This amendment establishes 20 days as the notice period. The court may shorten this time on its own motion or on motion of a party in interest. The notice includes both the date of the hearing and the date for filing objections, and must be accompanied by a copy of the plan or a summary of the plan in accordance with Rule 3015(d).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is amended to delete as unnecessary the references to subdivisions (h) and (i).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> does not require notice to equity security holders in a chapter 12 case. The procedural burden of requiring such notice is outweighed by the likelihood that all equity security holders of a family farmer will be informed of the progress of the case without formal notice. Subdivision (d) is amended to recognize that the United States trustee may convene a meeting of equity security holders pursuant to § 341(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)(2)</i> is amended and subdivision (f)(4) is deleted to require notice of any conversion of the case, whether the conversion is by court order or is effectuated by the debtor filing a notice of conversion pursuant to §§ 1208(a) or 1307(a). Subdivision (f)(8), renumbered (f)(7), is amended to include entry of an order confirming a chapter 12 plan. Subdivision (f)(9) is amended to increase the amount to $1,500.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (g) and (j)</i> are amended to delete the words “with the court” and subdivision (i) is amended to delete the words “with the clerk” because these phrases are unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (i)</i> is amended to require that the United States trustee receive notices required by subdivision (a)(2), (3) and (7) of this rule notwithstanding a court order limiting such notice to committees and to creditors and equity security holders who request such notices. Subdivision (i) is amended further to include committees elected pursuant to § 705 of the Code and to provide that committees of retired employees appointed in chapter 11 cases receive certain notices.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (k)</i> is derived from Rule X–1008. The administrative functions of the United States trustee pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 586(a) and standing to be heard on issues under § 307 and other sections of the Code require that the United States trustee be informed of developments and issues in every case except chapter 9 cases. The rule omits those notices described in subdivision (a)(1) because a meeting of creditors is convened only by the United States trustee, and those notices described in subdivision (a)(4) (date fixed for filing claims against a surplus), subdivision (a)(6) (time fixed to accept or reject proposed modification of a plan), subdivision (a)(8) (time fixed for filing proofs of claims in chapter 11 cases), subdivision (f)(3) (time fixed for filing claims in chapter 7, 12, and 13 cases), and subdivision (f)(5) (time fixed for filing complaint to determine dischargeability of debt) because these notices do not relate to matters that generally involve the United States trustee. Nonetheless, the omission of these notices does not prevent the United States trustee from receiving such notices upon request. The United States trustee also receives notice of hearings on applications for compensation or reimbursement without regard to the $500 limitation contained in subdivision (a)(7) of this rule. This rule is intended to be flexible in that it permits the United States trustee in a particular judicial district to request notices in certain categories, and to request not to receive notices in other categories, when the practice in that district makes that desirable.</p>

The validity and effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive law matters that are beyond the scope of these rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The notice requirement of subdivision (c)(3) is not applicable to an injunction contained in a plan if it is substantially the same as an injunction provided under the Code. For example, if a plan contains an injunction against acts to collect a discharged debt from the debtor, Rule 2002(c)(3) would not apply because that conduct would be enjoined under § 524(a)(2) upon the debtor’s discharge. But if a plan provides that creditors will be enjoined from asserting claims against persons who are not debtors in the case, the notice of the confirmation hearing must include the information required under Rule 2002(c)(3) because that conduct would not be enjoined by operation of the Code. <i>See</i> § 524(e).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The requirement that the notice identify the entities that would be subject to the injunction requires only reasonable identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would be subject to the injunction cannot be identified by name, the notice may describe them by class or category if reasonable under the circumstances. For example, it may be sufficient for the notice to identify the entities as “all creditors of the debtor” and for the notice to be published in a manner that satisfies due process requirements.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i> has been revised to clarify that where a creditor or indenture trustee files both a proof of claim which includes a mailing address and a separate request designating a mailing address, the last paper filed determines the proper address. The amendments also clarify that a request designating a mailing address is effective only with respect to a particular case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under Rule 2002(g), a duly filed proof of claim is considered a request designating a mailing address if a notice of no dividend has been given under Rule 2002(e), but has been superseded by a subsequent notice of possible dividend under Rule 3002(c)(5). A duly filed proof of interest is considered a request designating a mailing address of an equity security holder.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 2002(g)(3) is added to assure that notices to an infant or incompetent person under this rule are mailed to the appropriate guardian or other legal representative.

If the infant or incompetent person, or another person, files a request or proof of claim designating a different name and mailing address, the notices would have to be mailed to both names and addresses until the court resolved the issue as to the proper mailing address.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</i>.

Official Form 9, the form of the notice of the meeting of creditors that will become a part of the court’s file in the case, will include only the last four digits of the debtor’s social security number. This rule, however, directs the clerk to include the full social security number on the notice that is served on the creditors and other identified parties, unless the court orders otherwise in a particular case. This will enable creditors and other parties in interest who are in possession of the debtor’s social security number to verify the debtor’s identity and proceed accordingly. The filed Official Form 9, however, will not include the debtor’s full social security number. This will prevent the full social security number from becoming a part of the court’s file in the case, and the number will not be included in the court’s electronic records. Creditors who already have the debtor’s social security number will be able to verify the existence of a case under the debtor’s social security number, but any person searching the electronic case files without the number will not be able to acquire the debtor’s social security number.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</i>. The rule amendment was made in response to concerns of both private creditors and taxing authorities that truncating the social security number of a debtor to the last four digits would unduly hamper their ability to identify the debtor and govern their actions accordingly. Therefore, the Advisory Committee amended Rule 2002 to require the clerk to include the debtor’s full social security number on the notice informing creditors of the § 341 meeting and other significant deadlines in the case. This is essentially a continuation of the practice under the current rules, and the amendment is necessary because of the amendment to Rule 1005 that restricts publication of the social security number on the caption of the petition to the final four digits of the number.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The business of many entities is national in scope, and technology currently exists to direct the transmission of notice (both electronically and in paper form) to those entities in an accurate and much more efficient manner than by sending individual notices to the same creditor by separate mailings. The rule authorizes an entity and a notice provider to determine the manner of the service as well as to set the address or addresses to which the notices must be sent. For example, they could agree that all notices sent by the notice provider to the entity must be sent to a single, nationwide electronic or postal address. They could also establish local or regional addresses to which notices would be sent in matters pending in specific districts. Since the entity and notice provider also can agree on the date of the commencement of service under the agreement, there is no need to set a date in the rule after which notices would have to be sent to the address or addresses that the entity establishes. Furthermore, since the entity supplies the address to the notice provider, use of that address is conclusively presumed to be proper. Nonetheless, if that address is not used, the notice still may be effective if the notice is otherwise effective under applicable law. This is the same treatment given under Rule 5003(e) to notices sent to governmental units at addresses other than those set out in that register of addresses.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The remaining subdivisions of Rule 2002(g) continue to govern the addressing of a notice that is not sent pursuant to an agreement described in Rule 2002(g)(4).</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b57e223-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2008 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) is amended to provide for 25 days’ notice of the time for the court to make a final determination whether the plan in a small business case can serve as a disclosure statement. Conditional approval of a disclosure statement in a small business case is governed by Rule 3017.1 and does not require 25 days’ notice. The court may consider this matter in a hearing combined with the confirmation hearing in a small business case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because of the requirements of Rule 6004(g), subdivision (c)(1) is amended to require that a trustee leasing or selling personally identifiable information under § 363(b)(1)(A) or (B) of the Code, as amended in 2005, include in the notice of the lease or sale transaction a statement as to whether the lease or sale is consistent with a policy prohibiting the transfer of the information.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivisions (f)(9) and (10) are new. They reflect the 2005 amendments to §§ 342(d) and 704(b) of the Code. Section 342(d) requires the clerk to give notice to creditors shortly after the commencement of the case as to whether a presumption of abuse exists. Subdivision (f)(9) adds this notice to the list of notices that the clerk must give. Subdivision (f)(10) implements the amendment to § 704(b), which requires the court to provide a copy to all creditors of a statement by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator as to whether the debtor’s case would be presumed to be an abuse under § 707(b) not later than five days after receiving it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f)(11) is also added to provide notice to creditors of the debtor’s filing of a statement in a chapter 11, 12, or 13 case that there is no reasonable cause to believe that § 522(q) applies in the case. This allows a creditor who disputes that assertion to request a delay of the entry of the discharge in the case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (g)(2) of the rule is amended because the 2005 amendments to § 342(f) of the Code permit creditors in chapter 7 and 13 individual debtor cases to file a notice with any bankruptcy court of the address to which the creditor wishes all notices to be sent. The amendment to Rule 2002(g)(2) therefore only limits application of the subdivision when a creditor files a notice under § 342(f).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">New subdivision (g)(5) implements § 342(g)(1) which was added to the Code in 2005. Section 342(g)(1) allows a creditor to treat a notice as not having been brought to the creditor’s attention, and so potentially ineffective, until it is received by a person or organizational subdivision that the creditor has designated to receive notices under the Bankruptcy Code. Under that section, the creditor must have established reasonable procedures for such notices to be delivered to the designated person or subdivision. The rule provides that, in order to challenge a notice under § 342(g)(1), a creditor must have filed the name and address of the designated notice recipient, as well as a description of the procedures for directing notices to that recipient, prior to the time that the challenged notice was issued. The filing required by the rule may be made as part of a creditor’s filing under § 342(f), which allows a creditor to file a notice of the address to be used by all bankruptcy courts or by particular bankruptcy courts to provide notice to the creditor in cases under chapters 7 and 13. Filing the name and address of the designated notice recipient and the procedures for directing notices to that recipient will reduce uncertainty as to the proper party for receiving notice and limit factual disputes as to whether a notice recipient has been designated and as to the nature of procedures adopted to direct notices to the recipient.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (k) is amended to add notices given under subdivision (q) to the list of notices which must be served on the United States trustee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 1514(d) of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments, requires that such additional time as is reasonable under the circumstances be given to creditors with foreign addresses with respect to notices and the filing of a proof of claim. Thus, subdivision (p)(1) is added to this rule to give the court flexibility to direct that notice by other means shall supplement notice by mail, or to enlarge the notice period, for creditors with foreign addresses. If cause exists, such as likely delays in the delivery of mailed notices in particular locations, the court may order that notice also be given by email, facsimile, or private courier. Alternatively, the court may enlarge the notice period for a creditor with a foreign address. It is expected that in most situations involving foreign creditors, fairness will not require any additional notice or extension of the notice period. This rule recognizes that the court has discretion to establish procedures to determine, on its own initiative, whether relief under subdivision (p) is appropriate, but that the court is not required to establish such procedures and may decide to act only on request of a party in interest.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (p)(2) is added to the rule to grant creditors with a foreign address to which notices are mailed at least 30 days’ notice of the time within which to file proofs of claims if notice is mailed to the foreign address, unless the court orders otherwise. If cause exists, such as likely delays in the delivery of notices in particular locations, the court may extend the notice period for creditors with foreign addresses. The court may also shorten the additional notice time if circumstances so warrant. For example, if the court in a chapter 11 case determines that supplementing the notice to a foreign creditor with notice by electronic means, such as email or facsimile, would give the creditor reasonable notice, the court may order that the creditor be given only 20 days’ notice in accordance with Rule 2002(a)(7).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (p)(3) is added to provide that the court may, for cause, override a creditor’s designation of a foreign address under Rule 2002(g). For example, if a party in interest believes that a creditor has wrongfully designated a foreign address to obtain additional time when it has a significant presence in the United States, the party can ask the court to order that notices to that creditor be sent to an address other than the one designated by the foreign creditor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (q) is added to require that notice of the hearing on the petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding be given to the debtor, all administrators in foreign proceedings of the debtor, entities against whom provisional relief is sought, and entities with whom the debtor is engaged in litigation at the time of the commencement of the case. There is no need at this stage of the proceedings to provide notice to all creditors. If the foreign representative should take action to commence a case under another chapter of the Code, the rules governing those proceedings will operate to provide that notice is given to all creditors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule also requires notice of the court’s intention to communicate with a foreign court or foreign representative.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. Subdivision (g)(2) was amended to provide that the designated address of a governmental unit under Rule 5003(e) establishes an exception to the rule that a creditor’s address is to be taken from the debtor’s schedules. The fifth and sixth paragraphs of the Committee Note were amended to explain that change.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (p)(3) was added to the rule to provide that the court may override a creditor’s designation of a foreign mailing address under Rule 2002(g). This will permit a party in interest to seek court relief if a creditor has improperly designated a foreign address.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (q)(1) and (2) were amended by adopting language from § 101(24) to identify foreign representatives as “all persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor” rather than as “all administrators in foreign proceedings of the debtor.” References to Rule 5012 in subdivision (q)(2) and in the Committee Note were deleted.</p>

The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>

The amended rule provides, in keeping with Code § 1517(c), for the court to schedule a hearing to be held promptly on the petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding. The amended rule contemplates that a hearing on a request for provisional relief may sometimes overlap substantially with the merits of the petition for recognition. In that case, the court may choose to consolidate the hearing on the request for provisional relief with the hearing on the petition for recognition, see Rules 1018 and 7065, and accordingly shorten the usual 21-day notice period.</p>

Subdivision (a)(9) is added to require at least 21 days’ notice of the time for filing objections to confirmation of a chapter 13 plan. Subdivision (b)(3) is added to provide separately for 28 days’ notice of the date of the confirmation hearing in a chapter 13 case. These amendments conform to amended Rule 3015, which governs the time for presenting objections to confirmation of a chapter 13 plan. Other changes are stylistic.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (h) is amended to add cases under chapters 12 and 13 of the Bankruptcy Code and to conform the time periods in the subdivision to the respective deadlines for filing proofs of claim under Rule 3002(c).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (k) is amended to add a reference to subdivision (a)(9) of this rule. This change corresponds to the relocation of the deadline for objecting to confirmation of a chapter 13 plan from subdivision (b) to subdivision (a)(9). The rule thereby continues to require transmittal of notice of that deadline to the United States trustee.</p>

That subsection was erroneously redesignated as subdivision (<i>o</i>) in 2008 [1991], and amended to modify its time period from 20 to 21 days in 2009. Because the Bankruptcy Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2075, provides no authority to modify statutory language, the subdivision is now returned to the language used by Congress.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b5a5351-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 341(a) of the Code requires a meeting of creditors in a chapter 7, 11 or 13 case, and § 341(b) permits the court to order a meeting of equity security holders. A major change from prior law, however, prohibits the judge from attending or presiding over the meeting. Section 341(c).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule does not apply either in a case for the reorganization of a railroad or for the adjustment of debts of a municipality. Sections 1161 and 901 render §§ 341 and 343 inapplicable in these types of cases. Section 341 sets the requirement for a meeting of creditors and § 343 provides for the examination of the debtor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. The meeting is to be held between 20 and 40 days after the date of the order for relief. In a voluntary case, the date of the order for relief is the date of the filing of the petition (§ 301 of the Code); in an involuntary case, it is the date of an actual order (§ 303(i) of the Code).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> provides flexibility as to who will preside at the meeting of creditors. The court may designate a person to serve as presiding officer, such as the interim trustee appointed under § 701 of the Code. If the court does not designate anyone, the clerk will preside. In either case, creditors may elect a person of their own choosing. In any event, the clerk may remain to record the proceedings and take appearances. Use of the clerk is not contrary to the legislative policy of § 341(c). The judge remains insulated from any information coming forth at the meeting and any information obtained by the clerk must not be relayed to the judge.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although the clerk may preside at the meeting, the clerk is not performing any kind of judicial role, nor should the clerk give any semblance of performing such a role. It would be pretentious for the clerk to ascend the bench, don a robe or be addressed as “your honor”. The clerk should not appear to parties or others as any type of judicial officer.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In a chapter 11 case, if a committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed pursuant to § 1102(a)(1) of the Code and a chairman has been selected, the chairman will preside or a person, such as the attorney for the committee, may be designated to preside by the chairman.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the judge must fix the bond of the trustee but cannot be present at the meeting, the rule allows the creditors to recommend the amount of the bond. They should be able to obtain relevant information concerning the extent of assets of the debtor at the meeting.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (1) authorizes the presiding officer to administer oaths. This is important because the debtor’s examination must be under oath.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) has application only in a chapter 7 case. That is the only type of case under the Code that permits election of a trustee or committee. In all other cases, no vote is taken at the meeting of creditors. If it is necessary for the court to make a determination with respect to a claim, the meeting may be adjourned until the objection or dispute is resolved.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The second sentence recognizes that partnership creditors may vote for a trustee of a partner’s estate along with the separate creditors of the partner. Although § 723(c) gives the trustee of a partnership a claim against a partner’s estate for the full amount of partnership creditors’ claims allowed, the purpose and function of this provision are to simplify distribution and prevent double proof, not to disfranchise partnership creditors in electing a trustee of an estate against which they hold allowable claims.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> requires minutes and a record of the meeting to be maintained by the presiding officer. A verbatim record must be made of the debtor’s examination but the rule is flexible as to the means used to record the examination.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> recognizes that the court must be informed immediately about the election or nonelection of a trustee in a chapter 7 case. Pursuant to Rule 2008, the clerk officially informs the trustee of his election or appointment and how he is to qualify. The presiding person has no authority to resolve a disputed election.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">For purposes of expediency, the results of the election should be obtained for each alternative presented by the dispute and immediately reported to the court. Thus, when an interested party presents the dispute to the court, its prompt resolution by the court will determine the dispute and a new or adjourned meeting to conduct the election may be avoided. The clerk is not an interested party.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A creditors’ committee may be elected only in a chapter 7 case. In chapter 11 cases, a creditors’ committee is appointed pursuant to § 1102.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While a final meeting is not required, Rule 2002(f)(10) provides for the trustee’s final account to be sent to creditors.</p>

Many courts schedule meetings of creditors at various locations in the district. Because the clerk must schedule meetings at those locations, an additional 20 days for scheduling the meetings is provided under the amended rule.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b5a5353-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendment to subdivision (a) relating to the calling of the meeting of creditors in a chapter 12 case is consistent with the expedited procedures of chapter 12. Subdivision (a) is also amended to clarify that the United States trustee does not call a meeting of creditors in a chapter 9 case. Pursuant to § 901(a) of the Code, § 341 is inapplicable in chapter 9 cases. The other amendments to subdivisions (a), (b)(1), and (b)(2) and the additions of subdivisions (f) and (g) are derived from Rule X–1006 and conform to the 1986 amendments to § 341 of the Code. The second sentence of subdivision (b)(3) is amended because Rule 2009(e) is abrogated. Although the United States trustee fixes the date for the meeting, the clerk of the bankruptcy court transmits the notice of the meeting unless the court orders otherwise, as prescribed in Rule 2002(a)(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pursuant to § 702 and § 705 of the Code, creditors may elect a trustee and a committee in a chapter 7 case. Subdivision (b) of this rule provides that the United States trustee shall preside over any election that is held under those sections. The deletion of the last sentence of subdivision (b)(1) does not preclude creditors from recommending to the United States trustee the amount of the trustee’s bond when a trustee is elected. Trustees and committees are not elected in chapter 11, 12, and 13 cases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If an election is disputed, the United States trustee shall not resolve the dispute. For purposes of expediency, the United States trustee shall tabulate the results of the election for each alternative presented by the dispute. However, if the court finds that such tabulation is not feasible under the circumstances, the United States trustee need not tabulate the votes. If such tabulation is feasible and if the disputed vote or votes would affect the result of the election, the tabulations of votes for each alternative presented by the dispute shall be reported to the court. If a motion is made for resolution of the dispute in accordance with subdivision (d) of this rule, the court will determine the issue and another meeting to conduct the election may not be necessary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (f) and (g)</i> are derived from Rule X–1006(d) and (e), except that the amount is increased to $1,500 to conform to the amendment to Rule 2002(f).</p>

This extension will provide more flexibility for scheduling the meeting of creditors. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b5a5355-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—1999 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is amended to require the United States trustee to mail a copy of a report of a disputed election to any party in interest that has requested a copy of it. Also, if the election is for a trustee, the rule as amended will give a party in interest ten days from the filing of the report, rather than from the date of the meeting of creditors, to file a motion to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The substitution of “United States trustee” for “presiding officer” is stylistic. Section 341(a) of the Code provides that the United States trustee shall preside at the meeting of creditors. Other amendments are designed to conform to the style of Rule 2007.1(b)(3) regarding the election of a trustee in a chapter 11 case.</p>

Section 782 of the Code provides that the designation of a trustee or alternative trustee for the case is made by the Federal Reserve Board. Therefore, the meeting of creditors in those cases cannot include the election of a trustee.</p>

Subdivision (e) is amended to require the presiding official to file a statement after the adjournment of a meeting of creditors or equity security holders designating the period of the adjournment. The presiding official is the United States trustee or the United States trustee’s designee. This requirement will provide notice to parties in interest not present at the initial meeting of the date and time to which the meeting has been continued. An adjourned meeting is “held open” as permitted by § 1308(b)(1) of the Code. The filing of this statement will also discourage premature motions to dismiss or convert the case under § 1307(e).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. No changes were made to the language of the rule following publication. The Committee Note was revised to state more explicitly that adjournment of a meeting of creditors to a specific date constitutes holding it open for purposes of § 1308(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>

See generally 2 Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶¶ 343.02, 343.08, 343.13 (15th ed. 1981). It specifies the manner of moving for an examination. The motion may be heard <i>ex parte</i> or it may be heard on notice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rules 205(d) and 11–26.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> specifies the mode of compelling attendance of a witness or party for an examination and for the production of evidence under this rule. The subdivision is substantially declaratory of the practice that had developed under § 21a of the Act. See 2 Collier, <i>supra</i> ¶ 343.11.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This subdivision will be applicable for the most part to the examination of a person other than the debtor. The debtor is required to appear at the meeting of creditors for examination. The word “person” includes the debtor and this subdivision may be used if necessary to obtain the debtor’s attendance for examination.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 205(f) and is not a limitation on subdivision (c). Any person, including the debtor, served with a subpoena within the range of a subpoena must attend for examination pursuant to subdivision (c). Subdivision (d) applies only to the debtor and a subpoena need not be issued. There are no territorial limits on the service of an order on the debtor. See, <i>e.g., In re Totem Lodge &amp; Country Club, Inc</i>., 134 F. Supp. 158 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 205(g). The lawful mileage and fee for attendance at a United States court as a witness are prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 1821.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Definition of debtor</i>. The word “debtor” as used in this rule includes the persons specified in the definition in Rule 9001(5).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Spousal privilege</i>. The limitation on the spousal privilege formerly contained in § 21a of the Act is not carried over in the Code. For privileges generally, see Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence made applicable in cases under the Code by Rule 1101 thereof.</p>

R. Civ. P., made applicable by Rule 9016.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The subdivision is amended further to clarify that, in addition to the procedures for the issuance of a subpoena set forth in Rule 45 F. R. Civ. P., an attorney may issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of the court for the district in which a Rule 2004 examination is to be held if the attorney is authorized to practice, even if admitted pro hac vice, either in the court in which the case is pending or in the court for the district in which the examination is to be held. This provision supplements the procedures for the issuance of a subpoena set forth in Rule 45(a)(3)(A) and (B) F. R. Civ. P. and is consistent with one of the purposes of the 1991 amendments to Rule 45, to ease the burdens of interdistrict law practice.</p>

First, the provision now refers expressly to the production of electronically stored information, in addition to the production of documents. This change is an acknowledgment of the form in which information now commonly exists and the type of production that is frequently sought in connection with an examination under Rule 2004.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, subdivision (c) is amended to bring its subpoena provision into conformity with the current version of F.R.Civ.P. 45, which Rule 9016 makes applicable in bankruptcy cases. Under Rule 45, a subpoena always issues from the court where the action is pending, even for a deposition in another district, and an attorney admitted to practice in the issuing court may issue and sign it. In light of this procedure, a subpoena for a Rule 2004 examination is now properly issued from the court where the bankruptcy case is pending and by an attorney authorized to practice in that court, even if the examination is to occur in another district.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b5a53c0-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is a comprehensive regulation of solicitation and voting of proxies in liquidation cases. It is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 208. The rule applies only in chapter 7 cases because no voting occurs, other than on a plan, in a chapter 11 case. Former Bankruptcy Rule 208 did not apply to solicitations of acceptances of plans.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Creditor control was a basic feature of the Act and is continued, in part, by the Code. Creditor democracy is perverted and the congressional objective frustrated, however, if control of administration falls into the hands of persons whose principal interest is not in what the estate can be made to yield to the unsecured creditors but in what it can yield to those involved in its administration or in other ulterior objectives.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. The definition of proxy in the first paragraph of subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 208.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. The purpose of the rule is to protect creditors against loss of control of administration of their debtors’ estates to holders of proxies having interests that differ from those of the creditors. The rule does not prohibit solicitation but restricts it to those who were creditors at the commencement of the case or their freely and fairly selected representatives. The special role occupied by credit and trade associations is recognized in the last clause of subdivision (c)(1). On the assumption that members or subscribers may have affiliated with an association in part for the purpose of obtaining its services as a representative in liquidation proceedings, an established association is authorized to solicit its own members, or its regular customers or clients, who were creditors on the date of the filing of the petition. Although the association may not solicit nonmembers or nonsubscribers for proxies, it may sponsor a meeting of creditors at which a committee entitled to solicit proxies may be selected in accordance with clause (C) of subdivision (c)(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under certain circumstances, the relationship of a creditor, creditors’ committee, or association to the estate or the case may be such as to warrant rejection of any proxy solicited by such a person or group. Thus a person who is forbidden by the Code to vote his own claim should be equally disabled to solicit proxies from creditors. Solicitation by or on behalf of the debtor has been uniformly condemned, <i>e.g., In re White</i>, 15 F.2d 371 (9th Cir. 1926), as has solicitation on behalf of a preferred creditor, <i>Matter of Law</i>, 13 Am.B.R. 650 (S.D. Ill. 1905). The prohibition on solicitation by a receiver or his attorney made explicit by General Order 39 has been collaterally supported by rulings rejecting proxies solicited by a receiver in equity, <i>In re Western States Bldg.-Loan Ass’n</i>, 54 F.2d 415 (S.D. Cal. 1931), and by an assignee for the benefit of creditors, <i>Lines v. Falstaff Brewing Co</i>., 233 F.2d 927 (9th Cir. 1956).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> prohibits solicitation by any person or group having a relationship described in the preceding paragraph. It also makes no exception for attorneys or transferees of claims for collection. The rule does not undertake to regulate communications between an attorney and his regular client or between an attorney and a creditor who has asked the attorney to represent him in a proceeding under the Code, but any other communication by an attorney or any other person or group requesting a proxy from the owner of a claim constitutes a regulated solicitation. Solicitation by an attorney of a proxy from a creditor who was not a client prior to the solicitation is objectionable not only as unethical conduct as recognized by such cases as <i>In the Matter of Darland Company</i>, 184 F. Supp. 760 (S.D. Iowa 1960) but also and more importantly because the practice carries a substantial risk that administration will fall into the hands of those whose interest is in obtaining fees from the estate rather than securing dividends for creditors. The same risk attaches to solicitation by the holder of a claim for collection only.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. The regulation of solicitation and voting of proxies is achieved by the rule principally through the imposition of requirements of disclosure on the holders of two or more proxies. The disclosures must be made to the clerk before the meeting at which the proxies are to be voted to afford the clerk or a party in interest an opportunity to examine the circumstances accompanying the acquisition of the proxies in advance of any exercise of the proxies. In the light of the examination the clerk or a party in interest should bring to the attention of the judge any question that arises and the judge may permit the proxies that comply with the rule to be voted and reject those that do not unless the holders can effect or establish compliance in such manner as the court shall prescribe. The holders of single proxies are excused from the disclosure requirements because of the insubstantiality of the risk that such proxies have been solicited, or will be voted, in an interest other than that of general creditors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Every holder of two or more proxies must include in the submission a verified statement that no consideration has been paid or promised for the proxy, either by the proxyholder or the solicitor or any forwarder of the proxy. Any payment or promise of consideration for a proxy would be conclusive evidence of a purpose to acquire control of the administration of an estate for an ulterior purpose. The holder of multiple proxies must also include in the submission a verified statement as to whether there is any agreement by the holder, the solicitor, or any forwarder of the proxy for the employment of any person in the administration of an estate or for the sharing of any compensation allowed in connection with the administration of the estate. The provisions requiring these statements implement the policy of the Code expressed in § 504 as well as the policy of this rule to deter the acquisition of proxies for the purpose of obtaining a share in the outlays for administration. Finally the facts as to any consideration moving or promised to any member of a committee which functions as a solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder must be disclosed by the proxyholder. Such information would be of significance to the court in evaluating the purpose of the committee in obtaining, transmitting, or voting proxies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i> has counterparts in the local rules referred to in the Advisory Committee’s Note to former Bankruptcy Rule 208. Courts have been accorded a wide range of discretion in the handling of disputes involving proxies. Thus the referee was allowed to reject proxies and to proceed forthwith to hold a scheduled election at the same meeting. <i>E.g., In re Portage Wholesale Co</i>., 183 F.2d 959 (7th Cir. 1950); <i>In re McGill</i>, 106 Fed. 57 (6th Cir. 1901); <i>In re Deena Woolen Mills, Inc</i>., 114 F. Supp. 260, 273 (D. Me. 1953); <i>In re Finlay</i>, 3 Am.B.R. 738 (S.D.N.Y. 1900). The bankruptcy judge may postpone an election to permit a determination of issues presented by a dispute as to proxies and to afford those creditors whose proxies are rejected an opportunity to give new proxies or to attend an adjourned meeting to vote their own claims. <i>Cf. In the Matter of Lenrick Sales, Inc</i>., 369 F.2d 439, 442–43 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 822 (1967); <i>In the Matter of Construction Supply Corp</i>. 221 F. Supp. 124, 128 (E.D. Va. 1963). This rule is not intended to restrict the scope of the court’s discretion in the handling of disputes as to proxies.</p>

This provision recognizes the propriety of continuing a “prepetition” committee in an official capacity. Such a committee, however, must be found to have been fairly chosen and representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> does not necessarily require a hearing but does require a party in interest to bring to the court’s attention the fact that a prepetition committee had been organized and should be appointed. An application would suffice for this purpose. Party in interest would include the committee, any member of the committee, or any of its agents acting for the committee. Whether or not notice of the application should be given to any other party is left to the discretion of the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> implements § 1102(b)(1). The Code provision allows the court to appoint, as the official § 1102(a) committee, a “prepetition” committee if its members were fairly chosen and the committee is representative of the different kinds of claims. This subdivision of the rule indicates some of the factors the court may consider in determining whether the requirements of § 1102(b)(1) have been satisfied. In effect, the subdivision provides various factors which are similar to those set forth in Rule 2006 with respect to the solicitation and voting of proxies in a chapter 7 liquidation case.</p>

The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to § 1102 in chapter 11 cases. Section 1102 is applicable in chapter 9 cases pursuant to § 901(a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although § 1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the United States trustee to appoint a prepetition committee as the statutory committee if its members were fairly chosen and it is representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented, the amendment to this rule provides a procedure for judicial review of the appointment. The factors that may be considered by the court in determining whether the committee was fairly chosen are not new. A finding that a prepetition committee has not been fairly chosen does not prohibit the appointment of some or all of its members to the creditors’ committee. Although this rule deals only with judicial review of the appointment of prepetition committees, it does not preclude judicial review under Rule 2020 regarding the appointment of other committees.</p>

A motion for an order to appoint a trustee or examiner is a contested matter. Although the court decides whether the appointment is warranted under the particular facts of the case, it is the United States trustee who makes the appointment pursuant to § 1104(c) of the Code. The appointment is subject to approval of the court, however, which may be obtained by application of the United States trustee. Section 1104(c) of the Code requires that the appointment be made after consultation with parties in interest and that the person appointed be disinterested.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The requirement that connections with the United States trustee or persons employed in the United States trustee’s office be revealed is not intended to enlarge the definition of “disinterested person” in § 101(13) of the Code, to supersede executive regulations or other laws relating to appointments by United States trustees, or to otherwise restrict the United States trustee’s discretion in making appointments. This information is required, however, in the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the appointment process and to give the court all information that may be relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in approving the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Eligibility for voting in an election for a chapter 11 trustee is determined in accordance with Rule 2003(b)(3). Creditors whose claims are deemed filed under § 1111(a) are treated for voting purposes as creditors who have filed proofs of claim.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Proxies for the purpose of voting in the election may be solicited only by a creditors’ committee appointed under § 1102 or by any other party entitled to solicit proxies pursuant to Rule 2006. Therefore, a trustee or examiner who has served in the case, or a committee of equity security holders appointed under § 1102, may not solicit proxies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The procedures for reporting disputes to the court derive from similar provisions in Rule 2003(d) applicable to chapter 7 cases. An election may be disputed by a party in interest or by the United States trustee. For example, if the United States trustee believes that the person elected is ineligible to serve as trustee because the person is not “disinterested,” the United States trustee should file a report disputing the election.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The word “only” is deleted from subdivision (b), redesignated as subdivision (c), to avoid any negative inference with respect to the availability of procedures for obtaining review of the United States trustee’s acts or failure to act pursuant to Rule 2020.</p>

The published draft of proposed new subdivision (b)(3) of Rule 2017.1 [2007.1], and the Committee Note, was substantially revised to implement Mr. Patchan’s recommendations (described above), to clarify how a disputed election will be reported, and to make stylistic improvements.</p>

The person elected does not have to be appointed to the position. Rather, the filing of the report certifying the election itself constitutes the appointment. The section further provides that in the event of a dispute in the election of a trustee, the court must resolve the matter. The rule is amended to be consistent with § 1104(b)(2).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the United States trustee files a report certifying the election of a trustee, the person elected must provide a verified statement, similar to the statement required of professional persons under Rule 2014, disclosing connections with parties in interest and certain other persons connected with the case. Although court approval of the person elected is not required, the disclosure of the person’s connections will enable parties in interest to determine whether the person is disinterested.</p>

The rule recognizes this requirement and provides a procedure by which a party may obtain a court order finding that the appointment of a patient care ombudsman is unnecessary. In the absence of a timely motion under subdivision (a) of this rule, the court will enter an order directing the United States trustee to appoint the ombudsman.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) recognizes that, despite a previous order finding that a patient care ombudsman is not necessary, circumstances of the case may change or newly discovered evidence may demonstrate the necessity of an ombudsman to protect the interests of patients. In that event, a party may move the court for an order directing the appointment of an ombudsman.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the appointment of a patient care ombudsman is ordered, the United States trustee is required to appoint a disinterested person to serve in that capacity. Court approval of the appointment is not required, but subdivision (c) requires the person appointed, if not a State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, to file a verified statement similar to the statement filed by professional persons under Rule 2014 so that parties in interest will have information relevant to disinterestedness. If a party believes that the person appointed is not disinterested, it may file a motion asking the court to find that the person is not eligible to serve.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) permits parties in interest to move for the termination of the appointment of a patient care ombudsman. If the movant can show that there no longer is any need for the ombudsman, the court may order the termination of the appointment.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b5cc414-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is applicable in chapter 7 cases and, in part, in chapter 11 and 13 cases. The provisions in subdivisions (a) and (b) concerning creditor election of a trustee apply only in a chapter 7 case because it is only pursuant to § 702 of the Code that creditors may elect a trustee. Subdivision (c) of the rule applies in chapter 11 and 13 as well as chapter 7 cases; pursuant to § 1104 of the Code, the court may order the appointment of a trustee on application of a party in interest and, pursuant to § 1163 of the Code, the court must appoint a trustee in a railroad reorganization case. Subdivision (c) should not be taken as an indication that more than one trustee may be appointed for a single debtor. Section 1104(c) permits only one trustee for each estate. In a chapter 13 case, if there is no standing trustee, the court is to appoint a person to serve as trustee pursuant to § 1302 of the Code. There is no provision for a trustee in a chapter 9 case, except for a very limited purpose; see § 926 of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule recognizes that economical and expeditious administration of two or more estates may be facilitated not only by the selection of a single trustee for a partnership and its partners, but by such selection whenever estates are being jointly administered pursuant to Rule 1015. See <i>In the Matter of International Oil Co</i>., 427 F.2d 186, 187 (2d Cir. 1970). The rule is derived from former § 5c of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 210. The premise of § 5c of the Act was that notwithstanding the potentiality of conflict between the interests of the creditors of the partners and those of the creditors of the partnership, the conflict is not sufficiently serious or frequent in most cases to warrant the selection of separate trustees for the firm and the several partners. Even before the proviso was added to § 5c of the Act in 1938 to permit the creditors of a general partner to elect their separate trustee for his estate, it was held that the court had discretion to permit such an election or to make a separate appointment when a conflict of interest was recognized. <i>In re Wood</i>, 248 Fed. 246, 249–50 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 247 U.S. 512 (1918); 4 Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶ 723.04 (15th ed. 1980). The rule retains in subdivision (e) the features of the practice respecting the selection of a trustee that was developed under § 5 of the Act. Subdivisions (a) and (c) permit the court to authorize election of a single trustee or to make a single appointment when joint administration of estates of other kinds of debtors is ordered, but subdivision (d) requires the court to make a preliminary evaluation of the risks of conflict of interest. If after the election or appointment of a common trustee a conflict of interest materializes, the court must take appropriate action to deal with it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i> is derived from § 5e of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 210(f) and requires that the common trustee keep a separate account for each estate in all cases that are jointly administered.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendments to this rule are derived from Rule X–1005 and are necessary because the United States trustee, rather than the court, has responsibility for appointing trustees pursuant to §§ 701, 1104, 1202, and 1302 of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If separate trustees are ordered for chapter 7 estates pursuant to subdivision (d), separate and successor trustees should be chosen as prescribed in § 703 of the Code. If the occasion for another election arises, the United States trustee should call a meeting of creditors for this purpose. An order to select separate trustees does not disqualify an appointed or elected trustee from serving for one of the estates.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> is abrogated because the exercise of discretion by the United States trustee, who is in the Executive Branch, is not subject to advance restriction by rule of court. United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir. 1965), <i>cert. denied</i>, 365 U.S. 863 (1965); United States v. Frumento, 409 F.Supp. 136, 141 (E.D.Pa.), <i>aff’d</i>, 563 F.2d 1083 (3d Cir. 1977), <i>cert. denied</i>, 434 U.S. 1072 (1977); see, Smith v. United States, 375 F.2d 243 (5th Cir. 1967); House Report No. 95–595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 110 (1977). However, a trustee appointed by the United States trustee may be removed by the court for cause. See § 324 of the Code. Subdivision (d) of this rule, as amended, is consistent with § 324. Subdivision (f) is redesignated as subdivision (e).</p>

Accordingly, subdivisions (a) and (b) of the rule are amended to except cases under subchapter V from their coverage.

Subdivision (a) gives authority for approval by the court of a single bond to cover (1) a person who qualifies as trustee in a number of cases, and (2) a number of trustees each of whom qualifies in a different case. The cases need not be related in any way. Substantial economies can be effected if a single bond covering a number of different cases can be issued and approved at one time. When a blanket bond is filed, the trustee qualifies under subdivision (b) of the rule by filing an acceptance of the office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certified copy of an order approving the trustee’s bond given by a trustee under this rule or, when a blanket bond has been authorized, of a certified copy of acceptance. This rule supplements the Federal Rules of Evidence, which apply in bankruptcy cases. See Rule 1101 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The order of approval should conform to Official Form No. 25. See, however, § 549(c) of the Code which provides only for the filing of the petition in the real estate records to serve as constructive notice of the pendency of the case. See also Rule 2011 which prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certificate that the debtor is a debtor in possession.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 212(f). Reference should be made to § 322(a) and (d) of the Code which requires the bond to be filed with the bankruptcy court and places a two year limitation for the commencement of a proceeding on the bond. A bond filed under this rule should conform to Official Form No. 25. A proceeding on the bond of a trustee is governed by the rules in Part VII. See the Note accompanying Rule 7001. See also Rule 9025.</p>

Because a court order is not required for the appointment of a successor trustee, requiring the court to fix a time for filing the accounting is inefficient and unnecessary. The United States trustee has supervisory powers over trustees and may require the successor trustee to file the accounting within a certain time period. If the successor trustee fails to file the accounting within a reasonable time, the United States trustee or a party in interest may take appropriate steps including a request for an appropriate court order.

The first sentence of that rule is omitted because of the provisions in 28 U.S.C. §§ 586 and 604(f) creating panels of private trustees.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is not applicable to standing trustees serving in chapter 13 cases. See § 1302 of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A basic purpose of the rule is to prevent what Congress has defined as “cronyism.” Appointment or employment, whether in a chapter 7 or 11 case, should not center among a small select group of individuals unless the circumstances are such that it would be warranted. The public record of appointments to be kept by the clerk will provide a means for monitoring the appointment process.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> provides a convenient source for public review of fees paid from debtors’ estates in the bankruptcy courts. Thus, public recognition of appointments, fairly distributed and based on professional qualifications and expertise, will be promoted and notions of improper favor dispelled. This rule is in keeping with the findings of the Congressional subcommittees as set forth in the House Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, No. 95–595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 89–99 (1977). These findings included the observations that there were frequent appointments of the same person, contacts developed between the bankruptcy bar and the courts, and an unusually close relationship between the bar and the judges developed over the years. A major purpose of the new statute is to dilute these practices and instill greater public confidence in the system. Rule 2013 implements that laudatory purpose.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The United States trustee monitors applications filed under § 327 of the Code and may file with the court comments with respect to the approval of such applications. See 28 U.S.C. § 586(a)(3)(H). The United States trustee also monitors creditors’ committees in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 586(a)(3)(E). The addition of the second sentence of subdivision (a) is designed to enable the United States trustee to perform these duties.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> is also amended to require disclosure of the professional’s connections with the United States trustee or persons employed in the United States trustee’s office. This requirement is not intended to prohibit the employment of such persons in all cases or to enlarge the definition of “disinterested person” in § 101(13) of the Code. However, the court may consider a connection with the United States trustee’s office as a factor when exercising its discretion. Also, this information should be revealed in the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the bankruptcy system, especially since the United States trustee monitors and may be heard on applications for compensation and reimbursement of professionals employed under this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to § 1102 of the Code which is applicable in chapter 9 cases under § 901. In the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the bankruptcy system, a connection between the United States trustee and a professional employed by the committee should be revealed in every case, including a chapter 9 case. However, since the United States trustee does not have any role in the employment of professionals in chapter 9 cases, it is not necessary in such cases to transmit to the United States trustee a copy of the application under subdivision (a) of this rule. See 28 U.S.C. § 586(a)(3)(H).</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In <i>subdivision (a)</i> the times permitted to be fixed by the court in clause (3) for the filing of reports and summaries may be fixed by local rule or order.</p>

This subdivision prescribes duties on either the debtor or trustee in chapter 13 cases, depending on whether or not the debtor is engaged in business (§ 1304 of the Code). The duty of giving notice prescribed by subdivision (a)(4) is not included in a nonbusiness case because of its impracticability.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10–208(c) which, in turn, was derived from § 190 of the Act. The equity security holders to whom the reports should be sent are those of record at the time of transmittal of such reports.</p>

Subdivision (a) is designed to give parties in interest, including patients or their representatives, sufficient notice so that they will be able to review written reports or attend hearings at which reports are made. The rule permits a notice to relate to a single report or to periodic reports to be given during the case. For example, the ombudsman may give notice that reports will be made at specified intervals or dates during the case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) of the rule also requires that the notice be posted conspicuously at the health care facility in a place where it will be seen by patients and their families or others visiting the patients. This may require posting in common areas and patient rooms within the facility. Because health care facilities and the patients they serve can vary greatly, the locations of the posted notice should be tailored to the specific facility that is the subject of the report.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) requires the ombudsman to notify the patient and the United States trustee that the ombudsman is seeking access to confidential patient records so that they will be able to appear and be heard on the matter. This procedure should assist the court in reaching its decision both as to access to the records and appropriate restrictions on that access to ensure continued confidentiality. Notices given under this rule are subject to the provisions of applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of patients’ privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104–191 (HIPAA).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. Two stylistic changes were made to the rule. The reference to the court’s authority to order otherwise was moved from the beginning to the end of the first sentence of subdivision (a). On line 19, the word “patient” was substituted for “health” to be consistent with the Code.</p>

Section 704(a)(12), added to the Code by the 2005 amendments, authorizes the trustee to relocate patients when a health care business debtor’s facility is in the process of being closed. The Code permits the trustee to take this action without the need for any court order, but the notice required by this rule will enable a patient care ombudsman appointed under § 333, or a patient who contends that the trustee’s actions violate § 704(a)(12), to have those issues resolved before the patient is transferred.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule also permits the court to enter an order dispensing with or altering the notice requirement in proper circumstances.

No amendments are made to delineate further the requirements of the application because the amount of detail to be furnished is a function of the nature of the services rendered and the complexity of the case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is amended to require that the attorney for the debtor file the § 329 statement before the meeting of creditors.

Information required to be disclosed by the attorney for a debtor by § 329 of the Code and by the debtor in his Statement of Financial Affairs (Item #15 of Form No. 7, Item #20 of Form No. 8) will assist the court in determining whether to proceed under this rule. Section 60d was enacted in recognition of “the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too liberally with his property in employing counsel to protect him in view of financial reverses and probable failure.” <i>In re Wood &amp; Henderson</i>, 210 U.S. 246, 253 (1908). This rule, like § 60d of the Act and § 329 of the Code, is premised on the need for and appropriateness of judicial scrutiny of arrangements between a debtor and his attorney to protect the creditors of the estate and the debtor against overreaching by an officer of the court who is in a peculiarly advantageous position to impose on both the creditors and his client. 2 Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶ 329.02 (15th ed. 1980); MacLachlan, <i>Bankruptcy</i> 318 (1956). Rule 9014 applies to any contested matter arising under this rule.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b617ec2-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rules 8–210, 9–15 and 10–210 and it implements §§ 1109 and 1164 of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pursuant to § 1109 of the Code, parties in interest have a right to be heard and the Securities and Exchange Commission may raise and be heard on any issue but it may not take an appeal. That section is applicable in chapter 9 cases (§ 901 of the Code) and in chapter 11 cases, including cases under subchapter IV thereof for the reorganization of a railroad.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In a railroad reorganization case under subchapter IV of chapter 11, § 1164 also gives the right to be heard to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Department of Transportation and any state or local regulatory commission with jurisdiction over the debtor, but these entities may not appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule does not apply in adversary proceedings. For intervention in adversary proceedings, see Rule 7024. The rules do not provide any right of compensation to or reimbursement of expenses for intervenors or others covered by this rule. Section 503(b)(3)(D) and (4) is not applicable to the entities covered by this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8–210 and former Chapter X Rule 10–210. It permits intervention of an entity (see § 101(14), (21) of the Code) not otherwise entitled to do so under the Code or this rule. Such a party seeking to intervene must show cause therefor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> specifically grants the appropriate state’s Attorney General the right to appear and be heard on behalf of consumer creditors when it is in the public interest. See House Rep. No. 95–595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 189. While “consumer creditor” is not defined in the Code or elsewhere, it would include the type of individual entitled to priority under § 507(a)(5) of the Code, that is, an individual who has deposited money for the purchase, lease or rental of property or the purchase of services for the personal, family, or household use of the individual. It would also include individuals who purchased or leased property for such purposes in connection with which there may exist claims for breach of warranty.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This subdivision does not grant the Attorney General the status of party in interest. In other contexts, the Attorney General will, of course, be a party in interest as for example, in representing a state in connection with a tax claim.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> recognizes the possible interests of the Secretary of the Treasury or of the state of the debtor’s locale when a municipality is the debtor. It is derived from former Chapter IX Rule 9–15 and § 85(d) of the Act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10–210 which, in turn, was derived from § 206 of the Act. Section 206 has no counterpart in the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8–210(d). It gives the court flexibility in directing the type of future notices to be given intervenors.</p>

If a labor union would otherwise have the right to file an appeal or to be a party to an appeal, this rule does not preclude the labor union from exercising that right.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. The content of subdivision (a) is new. It sets forth two definitions. The first is the definition of the term “disclosable economic interest,” which is used in subdivisions (c)(2) and (c)(3). The definition of the term is intended to be sufficiently broad to cover any economic interest that could affect the legal and strategic positions a stakeholder takes in a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case. A disclosable economic interest extends beyond claims and interests owned by a stakeholder and includes, among other types of holdings, short positions, credit default swaps, and total return swaps.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The second definition is of “represent” or “represents.” The definition provides that representation requires active participation in the case or in a proceeding on behalf of another entity—either by taking a position on a matter before the court or by soliciting votes on the confirmation of a plan. Thus, for example, an attorney who is retained and consulted by a creditor or equity security holder to monitor the case, but who does not advocate any position before the court or engage in solicitation activities on behalf of that client, does not represent the creditor or equity security holder for purposes of this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. Subdivision (b)(1) specifies who is covered by the rule’s disclosure requirements. In addition to an entity, group, or committee that <i>represents</i> more than one creditor or equity security holder, the amendment extends the rule’s coverage to groups or committees that <i>consist of</i> more than one creditor or equity security holder. The rule no longer excludes official committees, except as specifically indicated. The rule applies to a group of creditors or equity security holders that act in concert to advance common interests (except when the group consists exclusively of affiliates or insiders of one another), even if the group does not call itself a committee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(2) excludes certain entities from the rule’s coverage. Even though these entities may represent multiple creditors or equity security holders, they do so under formal legal arrangements of trust or contract law that preclude them from acting on the basis of conflicting economic interests. For example, an indenture trustee’s responsibilities are defined by the indenture, and individual interests of bondholders would not affect the trustee’s representation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. Subdivision (c) sets forth the information that must be included in a verified statement required to be filed under this rule. Subdivision (c)(1) continues to require disclosure concerning the formation of a committee or group, other than an official committee, and the employment of an entity.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(2) specifies information that must be disclosed with respect to the entity and each member of the committee and group filing the statement. In the case of a committee or group, the information about the nature and amount of a disclosable economic interest must be specifically provided on a member-by-member basis, and not in the aggregate. The quarter and year in which each disclosable economic interest was acquired by each member of a committee or group (other than an official committee) that claims to represent others must also be specifically provided, except for a disclosable economic interest acquired more than a year before the filing of the petition. Although the rule no longer requires the disclosure of the precise date of acquisition or the amount paid for disclosable economic interests, nothing in this rule precludes either the discovery of that information or its disclosure when ordered by the court pursuant to authority outside this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(3) specifies information that must be disclosed with respect to creditors or equity security holders that are represented by an entity, group, or committee. This provision does not apply with respect to those represented by official committees. The information required to be disclosed under subdivision (c)(3) parallels that required to be disclosed under subdivision (c)(2)(A) and (B). The amendment also clarifies that under (c)(3) the nature and amount of each disclosable economic interest of represented creditors and shareholders must be stated as of the date of the verified statement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(4) requires the attachment of any instrument authorizing the filer of the verified statement to act on behalf of creditors or equity security holders.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. Subdivision (d) requires the filing of a supplemental statement at the time an entity, group, or committee takes a position before the court or solicits votes on a plan if there has been a material change in any of the information contained in its last filed statement. The supplemental verified statement must set forth the material changes that have occurred regarding the information required to be disclosed by subdivision (c) of this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. Subdivision (e) addresses the court’s authority to determine whether there has been a violation of this rule and to impose a sanction for any violation. It no longer addresses the court’s authority to determine violations of other applicable laws regulating the activities and personnel of an entity, group, or committee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication.</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. A definition of “represent” or “represents” was added, and the subdivision was divided into paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. The provision authorizing the court to require disclosure by an entity that seeks or opposes the granting of relief was deleted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the paragraph now designated as (1), language was added providing that groups, committees, and entities are covered by the rule only if they consist of or represent multiple creditors or equity security holders “that are (A) acting in concert to advance their common interests, and (B) not composed entirely of affiliates or insiders of one another.” The phrase “and, unless the court directs otherwise, every indenture trustee,” was deleted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(2) was added to specify entities that are not required to file a verified statement merely because they act in one of the designated capacities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. The authorization in subdivision (c)(2)(B) and (c)(3)(B) for the court to require the disclosure of the amount paid for a disclosable economic interest was deleted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The requirement in subdivision (c)(2)(C) and (c)(3)(C) for disclosure of the acquisition date of each disclosable economic interest was modified. The requirement was made applicable only to members of an unofficial group or committee that claims to represent any entity in addition to the members of the group or committee, and the date that must be disclosed was limited to the quarter and year of acquisition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. The requirement of monthly supplementation of a verified statement was modified to require supplementation whenever a covered group, committee, or entity takes a position before the court or solicits votes on the confirmation of a plan and there has been a material change in any fact disclosed in its most recently filed statement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. The provisions published as subdivision (e)(1)(B) and (C), which authorized the court to determine failures to comply with legal requirements other than those imposed by Rule 2019, were deleted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e)(2), which enumerated the materials the court could examine in making a determination of noncompliance, was deleted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Committee Note</i>. In the discussion of the definition of “disclosable economic interest,” the specific examples of “short positions, credit default swaps, and total return swaps” were added to illustrate the breadth of the definition. A sentence was added to the discussion of subdivision (c)(2) that states that the rule does not affect the right of a party to obtain information by means of discovery or as ordered by the court under any authority outside the rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Other changes</i>. Stylistic and organizational changes were made throughout the rule and Committee Note to reduce the length and clarify the meaning of the published proposal.</p>

Most of the acts of the United States trustee are not controversial and will go unchallenged. However, the United States trustee is not a judicial officer and does not resolve disputes regarding the propriety of its own actions. This rule, which is new, provides a procedure for judicial review of the United States trustee’s acts or failure to act in connection with the administration of the case. For example, if the United States trustee schedules a § 341 meeting to be held 90 days after the petition is filed, and a party in interest wishes to challenge the propriety of that act in view of § 341(a) of the Code and Rule 2003 which requires that the meeting be held not more than 40 days after the order for relief, this rule permits the party to do so by motion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule provides for review of acts already committed by the United States trustee, but does not provide for advisory opinions in advance of the act. This rule is not intended to limit the discretion of the United States trustee, provided that the United States trustee’s act is authorized by, and in compliance with, the Code, title 28, these rules, and other applicable law.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b617f1d-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rules 301 and 302. The Federal Rules of Evidence, made applicable to cases under the Code by Rule 1101, do not prescribe the evidentiary effect to be accorded particular documents. Subdivision (f) of this rule supplements the Federal Rules of Evidence as they apply to cases under the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. This subdivision is similar to former Bankruptcy Rule 302(c) and continues the requirement for the filing of any written security agreement and provides that the filing of a duplicate of a writing underlying a claim authenticates the claim with the same effect as the filing of the original writing. <i>Cf</i>. Rules 1001(4) and 1003 of F.R. of Evid. Subdivision (d) together with the requirement in the first sentence of subdivision (c) for the filing of any written security agreement, is designed to facilitate the determination whether the claim is secured and properly perfected so as to be valid against the trustee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. “Satisfactory evidence” of perfection, which is to accompany the proof of claim, would include a duplicate of an instrument filed or recorded, a duplicate of a certificate of title when a security interest is perfected by notation on such a certificate, a statement that pledged property has been in possession of the secured party since a specified date, or a statement of the reasons why no action was necessary for perfection. The secured creditor may not be required to file a proof of claim under this rule if he is not seeking allowance of a claim for a deficiency. But see § 506(d) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. The rule recognizes the differences between an unconditional transfer of a claim and a transfer for the purpose of security and prescribes a procedure for dealing with the rights of the transferor and transferee when the transfer is for security. The rule clarifies the procedure to be followed when a transfer precedes or follows the filing of the petition. The interests of sound administration are served by requiring the post-petition transferee to file with the proof of claim a statement of the transferor acknowledging the transfer and the consideration for the transfer. Such a disclosure will assist the court in dealing with evils that may arise out of post-bankruptcy traffic in claims against an estate. <i>Monroe v. Scofield</i>, 135 F.2d 725 (10th Cir. 1943); <i>In re Philadelphia &amp; Western Ry</i>., 64 F. Supp. 738 (E.D. Pa. 1946); <i>cf. In re Latham Lithographic Corp</i>., 107 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1939). Both paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subdivision, which deal with a transfer before the filing of a proof of claim, recognize that the transferee may be unable to obtain the required statement from the transferor, but in that event a sound reason for such inability must accompany the proof of claim filed by the transferee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraphs (3) and (4) clarify the status of a claim transferred for the purpose of security. An assignee for security has been recognized as a rightful claimant in bankruptcy. <i>Feder v. John Engelhorn &amp; Sons</i>, 202 F.2d 411 (2d Cir. 1953). An assignor’s right to file a claim notwithstanding the assignment was sustained in <i>In re R &amp; L Engineering Co</i>., 182 F. Supp. 317 (S.D. Cal. 1960). Facilitation of the filing of proofs by both claimants as holders of interests in a single claim is consonant with equitable treatment of the parties and sound administration. See <i>In re Latham Lithographic Corp</i>., 107 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1939).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraphs (2) and (4) of subdivision (e) deal with the transfer of a claim after proof has been filed. Evidence of the terms of the transfer required to be disclosed to the court will facilitate the court’s determination of the appropriate order to be entered because of the transfer.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (5) describes the procedure to be followed when an objection is made by the transferor to the transferee’s filed evidence of transfer.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> is amended to limit the court’s role to the adjudication of disputes regarding transfers of claims. If a claim has been transferred prior to the filing of a proof of claim, there is no need to state the consideration for the transfer or to submit other evidence of the transfer. If a claim has been transferred other than for security after a proof of claim has been filed, the transferee is substituted for the transferor in the absence of a timely objection by the alleged transferor. In that event, the clerk should note the transfer without the need for court approval. If a timely objection is filed, the court’s role is to determine whether a transfer has been made that is enforceable under nonbankruptcy law. This rule is not intended either to encourage or discourage postpetition transfers of claims or to affect any remedies otherwise available under nonbankruptcy law to a transferor or transferee such as for misrepresentation in connection with the transfer of a claim. “After notice and a hearing” as used in subdivision (e) shall be construed in accordance with paragraph (5).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The words “with the clerk” in subdivision (e)(2) and (e)(4) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>

The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>

Subdivision (c) is amended to prescribe with greater specificity the supporting information required to accompany certain proofs of claim and, in cases in which the debtor is an individual, the consequences of failing to provide the required information.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Existing subdivision (c) is redesignated as (c)(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(2) is added to require additional information to accompany proofs of claim filed in cases in which the debtor is an individual. When the holder of a claim seeks to recover—in addition to the principal amount of a debt—interest, fees, expenses, or other charges, the proof of claim must be accompanied by a statement itemizing these additional amounts with sufficient specificity to make clear the basis for the claimed amount.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If a claim is secured by a security interest in the property of the debtor and the debtor defaulted on the claim prior to the filing of the petition, the proof of claim must be accompanied by a statement of the amount required to cure the prepetition default.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If the claim is secured by a security interest in the debtor’s principal residence, the proof of claim must be accompanied by the attachment prescribed by the appropriate Official Form. In that attachment, the holder of the claim must provide the information required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (2). In addition, if an escrow account has been established in connection with the claim, an escrow account statement showing the account balance, and any amount owed, as of the date the petition was filed must be submitted in accordance with subparagraph (C). The statement must be prepared in a form consistent with the requirements of nonbankruptcy law. <i>See, e.g.</i>, 12 U.S.C. § 2601 <i>et seq.</i> (Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act). Thus the holder of the claim may provide the escrow account statement using the same form it uses outside of bankruptcy for this purpose.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subparagraph (D) of subdivision (c)(2) sets forth sanctions that the court may impose on a creditor in an individual debtor case that fails to provide information required by subdivision (c). Failure to provide the required information does not itself constitute a ground for disallowance of a claim. <i>See</i> § 502(b) of the Code. But when an objection to the allowance of a claim is made or other litigation arises concerning the status or treatment of a claim, if the holder of that claim has not complied with the requirements of this subdivision, the court may preclude it from presenting as evidence any of the omitted information, unless the failure to comply with this subdivision was substantially justified or harmless. The court retains discretion to allow an amendment to a proof of claim under appropriate circumstances or to impose a sanction different from or in addition to the preclusion of the introduction of evidence.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication.</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)(1)</i>. The requirement that the last account statement sent to the debtor be filed with the proof of claim was deleted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)(2)</i>. In subparagraph (C), a provision was added requiring the use of the appropriate Official Form for the attachment filed by a holder of a claim secured by a security interest in a debtor’s principal residence.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In subdivision (c)(2)(D), the clause “the holder shall be precluded” was deleted, and the provision was revised to state that “the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both” of the specified actions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Committee Note</i>. In the discussion of subdivision (c)(2), the term “security interest” was added to the sentence that discusses the required filing of a statement of the amount necessary to cure a prepetition default.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The discussion of subdivision (c)(2)(D) was expanded to clarify that failure to provide required documentation, by itself, is not a ground for disallowance of a claim and that the court has several options in responding to a creditor’s failure to provide information required by subdivision (c).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Other changes</i>. Stylistic changes were made to the rule and the Committee Note.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b63c912-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2012 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. Subdivision (c) is amended in several respects. The former requirement in paragraph (1) to file an original or duplicate of a supporting document is amended to reflect the current practice of filing only copies. The proof of claim form instructs claimants not to file the original of a document because it may be destroyed by the clerk’s office after scanning.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is further amended to add paragraph (3). Except with respect to claims secured by a security interest in the debtor’s real property (such as a home equity line of credit), paragraph (3) specifies information that must be provided in support of a claim based on an open-end or revolving consumer credit agreement (such as an agreement underlying the issuance of a credit card). Because a claim of this type may have been sold one or more times prior to the debtor’s bankruptcy, the debtor may not recognize the name of the person filing the proof of claim. Disclosure of the information required by paragraph (3) will assist the debtor in associating the claim with a known account. It will also provide a basis for assessing the timeliness of the claim. The date, if any, on which the account was charged to profit and loss (“charge-off” date) under subparagraph (A)(v) should be determined in accordance with applicable standards for the classification and account management of consumer credit. A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with subparagraph (A), as well as the applicable provisions of subdivisions (a), (b), (c)(2), and (e), constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim under subdivision (f).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To the extent that paragraph (3) applies to a claim, paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) is not applicable. A party in interest, however, may obtain the writing on which an open-end or revolving consumer credit claim is based by requesting in writing that documentation from the holder of the claim. The holder of the claim must provide the documentation within 30 days after the request is sent. The court, for cause, may extend or reduce that time period under Rule 9006.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication.</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)(1)</i>. The requirement for the attachment of a writing on which a claim is based was changed to require that a copy, rather than the original or a duplicate, of the writing be provided.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)(3)</i>. An exception to subparagraph (A) was added for open-end or revolving consumer credit agreements that are secured by the debtor’s real property.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A time limit of 30 days for responding to a written request under subparagraph (B) was added.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Committee Note</i>. A statement was added to clarify that if a proof of claim complies with subdivision (c)(3)(A), as well as with subdivisions (a), (b), (c)(2), and (e), it constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim under subdivision (f).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Other changes</i>. Stylistic changes were also made to the rule.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b63c928-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> of this rule is substantially a restatement of the general requirement that claims be proved and filed. The exceptions refer to Rule 3003 providing for the filing of claims in chapter 9 and 11 cases, and to Rules 3004 and 3005 authorizing claims to be filed by the debtor or trustee and the filing of a claim by a contingent creditor of the debtor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A secured claim need not be filed or allowed under § 502 or § 506(d) unless a party in interest has requested a determination and allowance or disallowance under § 502.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 302(e) but changes the time limits on the filing of claims in chapter 7 and 13 cases from six months to 90 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors. The special rule for early filing by a secured creditor in a chapter 13 case, in former Rule 13–302(e)(1) is not continued.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although the claim of a secured creditor may have arisen before the petition, a judgment avoiding the security interest may not have been entered until after the time for filing claims has expired. Under Rule 3002(c)(3) the creditor who did not file a secured claim may nevertheless file an unsecured claim within the time prescribed. A judgment does not become final for the purpose of starting the 30 day period provided for by paragraph (3) until the time for appeal has expired or, if an appeal is taken, until the appeal has been disposed of. <i>In re Tapp</i>, 61 F. Supp. 594 (W.D. Ky. 1945).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (1) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 302(e). The governmental unit may move for an extension of the 90 day period. Pursuant to § 501(c) of the Code, if the government does not file its claim within the proper time period, the debtor or trustee may file on its behalf. An extension is not needed by the debtor or trustee because the right to file does not arise until the government’s time has expired.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (4) is derived from former chapter rules. (See, <i>e.g</i>., Rule 11–33(a)(2)(B). In light of the reduced time it is necessary that a party with a claim arising from the rejection of an executory contract have sufficient time to file that claim. This clause allows the court to fix an appropriate time.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) is correlated with the provision in Rule 2002(e) authorizing notification to creditors of estates from which no dividends are anticipated. The clause permits creditors who have refrained from filing claims after receiving notification to be given an opportunity to file when subsequent developments indicate the possibility of a dividend. The notice required by this clause must be given in the manner provided in Rule 2002. The information relating to the discovery of assets will usually be obtained by the clerk from the trustee’s interim reports or special notification by the trustee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Provision is made in Rule 2002(a) and (h) for notifying all creditors of the fixing of a time for filing claims against a surplus under paragraph (6). This paragraph does not deal with the distribution of the surplus. Reference must also be made to § 726(a)(2)(C) and (3) which permits distribution on late filed claims.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (6) is only operative in a chapter 7 case. In chapter 13 cases, the plan itself provides the distribution to creditors which is not necessarily dependent on the size of the estate.</p>

Rule 1019(4) provides that claims actually filed by a creditor in a chapter 11 or 13 case shall be treated as filed in a superseding chapter 7 case. Claims deemed filed in a chapter 11 case pursuant to § 1111(a) of the Code are not considered as filed in a superseding chapter 7 case. The creditor must file a claim in the superseding chapter 7 case.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Reform Act amended § 726(a)(1) and added § 502(b)(9) to the Code to govern the effects of a tardily filed claim. Under § 502(b)(9), a tardily filed claim must be disallowed if an objection to the proof of claim is filed, except to the extent that a holder of a tardily filed claim is entitled to distribution under § 726(a)(1), (2), or (3).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The phrase “in accordance with this rule” is deleted from Rule 3002(a) to clarify that the effect of filing a proof of claim after the expiration of the time prescribed in Rule 3002(c) is governed by § 502(b)(9) of the Code, rather than by this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 502(b)(9) of the Code provides that a claim of a governmental unit shall be timely filed if it is filed “before 180 days after the date of the order for relief” or such later time as the Bankruptcy Rules provide. To avoid any confusion as to whether a governmental unit’s proof of claim is timely filed under § 502(b)(9) if it is filed on the 180th day after the order for relief, paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) provides that a governmental unit’s claim is timely if it is filed not later than 180 days after the order for relief.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">References to “the United States, a state, or subdivision thereof” in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) are changed to “governmental unit” to avoid different treatment among foreign and domestic governments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>GAP Report on Rule 3002</i>. After publication of the proposed amendments, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 amended sections 726 and 502(b) of the Code to clarify the rights of creditors who tardily file a proof of claim. In view of the Reform Act, proposed new subdivision (d) of Rule 3002 has been deleted from the proposed amendments because it is no longer necessary. In addition, subdivisions (a) and (c) have been changed after publication to clarify that the effect of tardily filing a proof of claim is governed by § 502(b)(9) of the Code, rather than by this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendments to § 502(b) also provide that a governmental unit’s proof of claim is timely filed if it is filed before 180 days after the order for relief. Proposed amendments to Rule 3002(c)(1) were added to the published amendments to conform to this statutory change and to avoid any confusion as to whether a claim by a governmental unit is timely if it is filed on the 180th day.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The committee note has been re-written to explain the rule changes designed to conform to the Reform Act.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b63c92c-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2008 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(1) is amended to reflect the addition of § 1308 to the Bankruptcy Code in 2005. This provision requires that chapter 13 debtors file tax returns during the pendency of the case, and imposes bankruptcy-related consequences if debtors fail to do so. Subdivision (c)(1) provides additional time for governmental units to file a proof of claim for tax obligations with respect to tax returns filed during the pendency of a chapter 13 case. The amendment also allows the governmental unit to move for additional time to file a proof of claim prior to expiration of the applicable filing period.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(5) of the rule is amended to set a new period for providing notice to creditors that they may file a proof of claim in a case in which they were previously informed that there was no need to file a claim. Under Rule 2002(e), if it appears that there will be no distribution to creditors, the creditors are notified of this fact and are informed that if assets are later discovered and a distribution is likely that a new notice will be given to the creditors. This second notice is prescribed by Rule 3002(c)(5). The rule is amended to direct the clerk to give at least 90 days’ notice of the time within which creditors may file a proof of claim. Setting the deadline in this manner allows the notices being sent to creditors to be more accurate regarding the deadline than was possible under the prior rule. The rule previously began the 90 day notice period from the time of the mailing of the notice, a date that could vary and generally would not even be known to the creditor. Under the amended rule, the notice will identify a specific bar date for filing proofs of claim thereby being more helpful to the creditors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(6) is added to give the court discretion to extend the time for filing a proof of claim for a creditor who received notice of the time to file the claim at a foreign address, if the court finds that the notice was not sufficient, under the particular circumstances, to give the foreign creditor a reasonable time to file a proof of claim. This amendment is designed to comply with § 1514(d), added to the Code by the 2005 amendments, and requires that the rules and orders of the court provide such additional time as is reasonable under the circumstances for foreign creditors to file claims in cases under all chapters of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Other changes are stylistic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. Subdivision (c)(1) was amended to allow governmental units to move for an enlargement of the time to file a proof of claim. The Committee Note was amended to describe this addition to the rule.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b63c92d-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2017 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) is amended to clarify that a creditor, including a secured creditor, must file a proof of claim in order to have an allowed claim. The amendment also clarifies, in accordance with § 506(d), that the failure of a secured creditor to file a proof of claim does not render the creditor’s lien void. The inclusion of language from § 506(d) is not intended to effect any change of law with respect to claims subject to setoff under § 553. The amendment preserves the existing exceptions to this rule under Rules 1019(3), 3003, 3004, and 3005. Under Rule 1019(3), a creditor does not need to file another proof of claim after conversion of a case to chapter 7. Rule 3003 governs the filing of a proof of claim in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. Rules 3004 and 3005 govern the filing of a proof of claim by the debtor, trustee, or another entity if a creditor does not do so in a timely manner.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is amended to alter the calculation of the bar date for proofs of claim in chapter 7, chapter 12, and chapter 13 cases. The amendment changes the time for filing a proof of claim in a voluntary chapter 7 case, a chapter 12 case, or a chapter 13 case from 90 days after the § 341 meeting of creditors to 70 days after the petition date. If a case is converted to chapter 12 or chapter 13, the 70-day time for filing runs from the order of conversion. If a case is converted to chapter 7, Rule 1019(2) provides that a new time period for filing a claim commences under Rule 3002. In an involuntary chapter 7 case, a 90-day time for filing applies and runs from the entry of the order for relief.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(6) is amended to expand the exception to the bar date for cases in which a creditor received insufficient notice of the time to file a proof of claim. The amendment provides that the court may extend the time to file a proof of claim if the debtor fails to file a timely list of names and addresses of creditors as required by Rule 1007(a). The amendment also clarifies that if a court grants a creditor’s motion under this rule to extend the time to file a proof of claim, the extension runs from the date of the court’s decision on the motion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(7) is added to provide a two-stage deadline for filing mortgage proofs of claim secured by an interest in the debtor’s principal residence. Those proofs of claim must be filed with the appropriate Official Form mortgage attachment within 70 days of the order for relief. The claim will be timely if any additional documents evidencing the claim, as required by Rule 3001(c)(1) and (d), are filed within 120 days of the order for relief. The order for relief is the commencement of the case upon filing a petition, except in an involuntary case. See § 301 and § 303(h). The confirmation of a plan within the 120-day period set forth in subdivision (c)(7)(B) does not prohibit an objection to any proof of claim.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b63c94e-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2011</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is new. It is added to aid in the implementation of § 1322(b)(5), which permits a chapter 13 debtor to cure a default and maintain payments on a home mortgage over the course of the debtor’s plan. It applies regardless of whether the trustee or the debtor is the disbursing agent for postpetition mortgage payments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to be able to fulfill the obligations of § l322(b)(5), a debtor and the trustee have to be informed of the exact amount needed to cure any prepetition arrearage, <i>see</i> Rule 3001(c)(2), and the amount of the postpetition payment obligations. If the latter amount changes over time, due to the adjustment of the interest rate, escrow account adjustments, or the assessment of fees, expenses, or other charges, notice of any change in payment amount needs to be conveyed to the debtor and trustee. Timely notice of these changes will permit the debtor or trustee to challenge the validity of any such charges, if appropriate, and to adjust postpetition mortgage payments to cover any undisputed claimed adjustment. Compliance with the notice provision of the rule should also eliminate any concern on the part of the holder of the claim that informing a debtor of a change in postpetition payment obligations might violate the automatic stay.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. Subdivision (a) specifies that this rule applies only in a chapter 13 case to claims secured by a security interest in the debtor’s principal residence.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. Subdivision (b) requires the holder of a claim to notify the debtor, debtor’s counsel, and the trustee of any postpetition change in the mortgage payment amount at least 21 days before the new payment amount is due.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. Subdivision (c) requires an itemized notice to be given, within 180 days of incurrence, of any postpetition fees, expenses, or charges that the holder of the claim asserts are recoverable from the debtor or against the debtor’s principal residence. This might include, for example, inspection fees, late charges, or attorney’s fees.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. Subdivision (d) provides the method of giving the notice under subdivisions (b) and (c). In both instances, the holder of the claim must give notice of the change as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form. In addition to serving the debtor, debtor’s counsel, and the trustee, the holder of the claim must also file the notice on the claims register in the case as a supplement to its proof of claim. Rule 3001(f) does not apply to any notice given under subdivision (b) or (c), and therefore the notice will not constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the payment change or of the fee, expense, or charge.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. Subdivision (e) permits the debtor or trustee, within a year after service of a notice under subdivision (c), to seek a determination by the court as to whether the fees, expenses, or charges set forth in the notice are required by the underlying agreement or applicable nonbankruptcy law to cure a default or maintain payments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i>. Subdivision (f) requires the trustee to issue a notice to the holder of the claim, the debtor, and the debtor’s attorney within 30 days after completion of payments under the plan. The notice must (1) indicate that all amounts required to cure a default on a claim secured by the debtor’s principal residence have been paid, and (2) direct the holder to comply with subdivision (g). If the trustee fails to file this notice within the required time, this subdivision also permits the debtor to file and serve the notice on the trustee and the holder of the claim.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i>. Subdivision (g) governs the response of the holder of the claim to the trustee’s or debtor’s notice under subdivision (f). Within 21 days after service of notice of the final cure payment, the holder of the claim must file and serve a statement indicating whether the prepetition default has been fully cured and also whether the debtor is current on all payments in accordance with § 1322(b)(5) of the Code. If the holder of the claim contends that all cure payments have not been made or that the debtor is not current on other payments required by § 1322(b)(5), the response must itemize all amounts, other than regular future installment payments, that the holder contends are due.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (h)</i>. Subdivision (h) provides a procedure for the judicial resolution of any disputes that may arise about payment of a claim secured by the debtor’s principal residence. Within 21 days after the service of the statement under (g), the trustee or debtor may move for a determination by the court of whether any default has been cured and whether any other non-current obligations remain outstanding.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (i)</i>. Subdivision (i) specifies sanctions that may be imposed if the holder of a claim fails to provide any of the information as required by subdivisions (b), (c), or (g).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If, after the chapter 13 debtor has completed payments under the plan and the case has been closed, the holder of a claim secured by the debtor’s principal residence seeks to recover amounts that should have been but were not disclosed under this rule, the debtor may move to have the case reopened in order to seek sanctions against the holder of the claim under subdivision (i).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication.</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. As part of organizational changes intended to make the rule shorter and clearer, a new subdivision (a) was inserted that specifies the applicability of the rule. Other subdivision designations were changed accordingly.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. The timing of the notice of payment change, addressed in subdivision (a) of the published rule, was changed from 30 to 21 days before payment must be made in the new amount.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. The provisions of the published rule prescribing the procedure for providing notice of payment changes and of fees, expenses, and charges were moved to subdivision (d).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. As part of the organizational revision of the rule, the provision governing the resolution of disputes over claimed fees, expenses, or charges was moved to this subdivision.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i>. The triggering event for the filing of the notice of final cure payment was changed to the debtor’s completion of all payments required under the plan. A sentence was added requiring the notice to inform the holder of the mortgage claim of its obligation to file and serve a response under subdivision (g).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (h)</i>. The caption of this subdivision (which was subdivision (f) as published), was changed to describe its content more precisely.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (i)</i>. The clause “the holder shall be precluded” was deleted, and the provision was revised to state that “the court may, after notice and hearing, take either or both” of the specified actions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Committee Note</i>. A sentence was added to the first paragraph to clarify that the rule applies regardless of whether ongoing mortgage payments are made directly by the debtor or disbursed through the chapter 13 trustee. Other changes were made to the Committee Note to reflect the changes made to the rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Other changes</i>. Stylistic changes were made throughout the rule and Committee Note.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b63c94f-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2016 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) is amended to clarify the applicability of the rule. Its provisions apply whenever a chapter 13 plan provides that contractual payments on the debtor’s home mortgage will be maintained, whether they will be paid by the trustee or directly by the debtor. The reference to § 1322(b)(5) of the Code is deleted to make clear that the rule applies even if there is no prepetition arrearage to be cured. So long as a creditor has a claim that is secured by a security interest in the debtor’s principal residence and the plan provides that contractual payments on the claim will be maintained, the rule applies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) is further amended to provide that, unless the court orders otherwise, the notice obligations imposed by this rule cease on the effective date of an order granting relief from the automatic stay with regard to the debtor’s principal residence. Debtors and trustees typically do not make payments on mortgages after the stay relief is granted, so there is generally no need for the holder of the claim to continue providing the notices required by this rule. Sometimes, however, there may be reasons for the debtor to continue receiving mortgage information after stay relief. For example, the debtor may intend to seek a mortgage modification or to cure the default. When the court determines that the debtor has a need for the information required by this rule, the court is authorized to order that the notice obligations remain in effect or be reinstated after the relief from the stay is granted.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b63c950-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) is subdivided and amended in two respects. First, it is amended in what is now subdivision (b)(1) to authorize courts to modify its requirements for claims arising from home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Because payments on HELOCs may adjust frequently and in small amounts, the rule provides flexibility for courts to specify alternative procedures for keeping the person who is maintaining payments on the loan apprised of the current payment amount. Courts may specify alternative requirements for providing notice of changes in HELOC payment amounts by local rules or orders in individual cases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, what is now subdivision (b)(2) is amended to acknowledge the right of the trustee, debtor, or other party in interest, such as the United States trustee, to object to a change in a home-mortgage payment amount after receiving notice of the change under subdivision (b)(1). The amended rule does not set a deadline for filing a motion for a determination of the validity of the payment change, but it provides as a general matter—subject to a contrary court order—that if no motion has been filed on or before the day before the change is to take effect, the announced change goes into effect. If there is a later motion and a determination that the payment change was not required to maintain payments under § 1322(b)(5), appropriate adjustments will have to be made to reflect any overpayments. If, however, a motion is made during the time specified in subdivision (b)(2), leading to a suspension of the payment change, a determination that the payment change was valid will require the debtor to cure the resulting default in order to be current on the mortgage at the end of the bankruptcy case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e) is amended to allow parties in interest in addition to the debtor or trustee, such as the United States trustee, to seek a determination regarding the validity of any claimed fee, expense, or charge.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. This general statement implements §§ 925 and 1111(a) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. This subdivision permits, in paragraph (1), the filing of a proof of claim but does not make it mandatory.

It is the creditor’s responsibility to determine if the claim is accurately listed. Notice of the provision of this rule is provided for in Official Form No. 16, the order for the meeting of creditors.

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b663a69-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 303 but conforms with the changes made by § 501(c) of the Code. Rule 303 permitted only the filing of tax and wage claims by the debtor. Section 501(c) of the Code, however, permits the filing by the debtor or trustee on behalf of any creditor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is the policy of the Code that debtors’ estates should be administered for the benefit of creditors without regard to the dischargeability of their claims. After their estates have been closed, however, discharged debtors may find themselves saddled with liabilities, particularly for taxes, which remain unpaid because of the failure of creditors holding nondischargeable claims to file proofs of claim and receive distributions thereon. The result is that the debtor is deprived of an important benefit of the Code without any fault or omission on the debtor’s part and without any objective of the Code being served thereby.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 501(c) of the Code authorizes a debtor or trustee to file a proof of claim for any holder of a claim. Although all claims may not be nondischargeable, it may be difficult to determine, in particular, whether tax claims survive discharge. See Plumb, <i>Federal Tax Liens and Priorities in Bankruptcy</i>, 43 Ref. J. 37, 43–44 (1969); 1 Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶17.14 (14th ed. 1967); 3 <i>id</i>. ¶ 523.06 (15th ed. 1979). To eliminate the necessity of the resolution of this troublesome issue, the option accorded the debtor by the Code does not depend on the nondischargeability of the claim. No serious administrative problems and no unfairness to creditors seemed to develop from adoption of Rule 303, the forerunner to § 501(c). The authority to file is conditioned on the creditor’s failure to file the proof of claim on or before the first date set for the meeting of creditors, which is the date a claim must ordinarily be filed in order to be voted in a chapter 7 case. Notice to the creditor is provided to enable him to file a proof of claim pursuant to Rule 3002, which proof, when filed, would supersede the proof filed by the debtor or trustee. Notice to the trustee would serve to alert the trustee to the special character of the proof and the possible need for supplementary evidence of the validity and amount of the claim. If the trustee does not qualify until after a proof of claim is filed by the debtor pursuant to this rule, he should be notified as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To the extent the claim is allowed and dividends paid thereon, it will be reduced or perhaps paid in full. If the claim is also filed pursuant to Rule 3005, only one distribution thereon may be made. As expressly required by Rule 3005 and by the purpose of this rule such distribution must diminish the claim.</p>

During the first 90 days of that period the creditor in a chapter 7 or 13 case may file a claim as provided by Rule 3002(c). If the creditor fails to file a claim, the debtor or trustee shall have an additional 30 days thereafter to file the claim. A proof of claim filed by a creditor supersedes a claim filed by the debtor or trustee only if it is timely filed within the 90 days allowed under Rule 3002(c).</p>

Under that provision, the debtor or trustee may file proof of a claim if the creditor fails to do so in a timely fashion. The rule previously authorized the debtor and the trustee to file a claim as early as the day after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under § 341(a). Under the amended rule, the debtor and trustee must wait until the creditor’s opportunity to file a claim has expired. Providing the debtor and the trustee with the opportunity to file a claim ensures that the claim will participate in any distribution in the case. This is particularly important for claims that are nondischargeable.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the debtor and trustee cannot file a proof of claim until after the creditor’s time to file has expired, the rule no longer permits the creditor to file a proof of claim that will supersede the claim filed by the debtor or trustee. The rule leaves to the courts the issue of whether to permit subsequent amendment of such proof of claim.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b663a81-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rules 305 and 10–404.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since 1938 it has generally been held that Rule 41 F.R.Civ.P. governs the withdrawal of a proof of claim. <i>In re Empire Coal Sales Corp</i>., 45 F. Supp. 974, 976 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d sub nom. <i>Kleid v. Ruthbell Coal Co</i>., 131 F.2d 372, 373 (2d Cir. 1942); <i>Kelso v. MacLaren</i>, 122 F.2d 867, 870 (8th Cir. 1941); <i>In re Hills</i>, 35 F. Supp. 532, 533 (W.D. Wash. 1940). Accordingly, the cited cases held that after an objection has been filed a proof of claim may be withdrawn only subject to approval by the court. This constitutes a restriction of the right of withdrawal as recognized by some though by no means all of the cases antedating the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 3 Collier <i>Bankruptcy</i>, ¶ 57.12 (14th ed. 1961); Note, 20 Bost. U. L. Rev. 121 (1940).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The filing of a claim does not commence an adversary proceeding but the filing of an objection to the claim initiates a contest that must be disposed of by the court. This rule recognizes the applicability of the considerations underlying Rule 41(a) F.R.Civ.P. to the withdrawal of a claim after it has been put in issue by an objection. Rule 41(a)(2) F.R.Civ.P. requires leave of court to obtain dismissal over the objection of a defendant who has pleaded a counterclaim prior to the service of the plaintiff’s motion to dismiss. Although the applicability of this provision to the withdrawal of a claim was assumed in <i>Conway v. Union Bank of Switzerland</i>, 204 F.2d 603, 608 (2d Cir. 1953), <i>Kleid v. Ruthbell Coal Co., supra, Kelso v. MacLaren, supra</i>, and <i>In re Hills, supra</i>, this rule vests discretion in the court to grant, deny, or condition the request of a creditor to withdraw, without regard to whether the trustee has filed a merely defensive objection or a complaint seeking an affirmative recovery of money or property from the creditor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A number of pre-1938 cases sustained denial of a creditor’s request to withdraw proof of claim on the ground of estoppel or election of remedies. 2 Remington, <i>Bankruptcy</i> 186 (Henderson ed. 1956); <i>cf</i>. 3 Collier, <i>supra</i> ¶ 57.12, at 201 (1964). Voting a claim for a trustee was an important factor in the denial of a request to withdraw in <i>Standard Varnish Works v. Haydock</i>, 143 Fed. 318, 319–20 (6th Cir. 1906), and <i>In re Cann</i>, 47 F.2d 661, 662 (W.D. Pa. 1931). And it has frequently been recognized that a creditor should not be allowed to withdraw a claim after accepting a dividend. <i>In re Friedmann</i>, 1 Am. B. R. 510, 512 (Ref., S.D.N.Y. 1899); 3 Collier 205 (1964); <i>cf. In re O’Gara Coal Co</i>., 12 F.2d 426, 429 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 271 U.S. 683 (1926). It was held in <i>Industrial Credit Co. v. Hazen</i>, 222 F.2d 225 (8th Cir. 1955), however, that although a claimant had participated in the first meeting of creditors and in the examination of witnesses, the creditor was entitled under Rule 41(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. to withdraw the claim as of right by filing a notice of withdrawal before the trustee filed an objection under § 57g of the Act. While this rule incorporates the post-1938 case law referred to in the first paragraph of this note, it rejects the inference drawn in the <i>Hazen</i> case that Rule 41(a) F.R.Civ.P. supersedes the pre-1938 case law that vests discretion in the court to deny or restrict withdrawal of a claim by a creditor on the ground of estoppel or election of remedies. While purely formal or technical participation in a case by a creditor who has filed a claim should not deprive the creditor of the right to withdraw the claim, a creditor who has accepted a dividend or who has voted in the election of a trustee or otherwise participated actively in proceedings in a case should be permitted to withdraw only with the approval of the court on terms it deems appropriate after notice to the trustee. 3 Collier 205–06 (1964).</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b663aa3-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from § 47a(8) of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 306. It prescribes the manner in which an objection to a claim shall be made and notice of the hearing thereon given to the claimant. The requirement of a writing does not apply to an objection to the allowance of a claim for the purpose of voting for a trustee or creditors’ committee in a chapter 7 case. See Rule 2003.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The contested matter initiated by an objection to a claim is governed by rule 9014, unless a counterclaim by the trustee is joined with the objection to the claim. The filing of a counterclaim ordinarily commences an adversary proceeding subject to the rules in Part VII.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While the debtor’s other creditors may make objections to the allowance of a claim, the demands of orderly and expeditious administration have led to a recognition that the right to object is generally exercised by the trustee. Pursuant to § 502(a) of the Code, however, any party in interest may object to a claim. But under § 704 the trustee, if any purpose would be served thereby, has the duty to examine proofs of claim and object to improper claims.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By virtue of the automatic allowance of a claim not objected to, a dividend may be paid on a claim which may thereafter be disallowed on objection made pursuant to this rule. The amount of the dividend paid before the disallowance in such event would be recoverable by the trustee in an adversary proceeding.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b663aa5-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2007 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is amended in a number of ways. First, the amendment prohibits a party in interest from including in a claim objection a request for relief that requires an adversary proceeding. A party in interest may, however, include an objection to the allowance of a claim in an adversary proceeding. Unlike a contested matter, an adversary proceeding requires the service of a summons and complaint, which puts the defendant on notice of the potential for an affirmative recovery. Permitting the plaintiff in the adversary proceeding to include an objection to a claim would not unfairly surprise the defendant as might be the case if the action were brought as a contested matter that included an action to obtain relief of a kind specified in Rule 7001.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule as amended does not require that a party include an objection to the allowance of a claim in an adversary proceeding. If a claim objection is filed separately from a related adversary proceeding, the court may consolidate the objection with the adversary proceeding under Rule 7042.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule also is amended to authorize the filing of a pleading that joins objections to more than one claim. Such filings present a significant opportunity for the efficient administration of large cases, but the rule includes restrictions on the use of these omnibus objections to ensure the protection of the due process rights of the claimants.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Unless the court orders otherwise, objections to more than one claim may be joined in a single pleading only if all of the claims were filed by the same entity, or if the objections are based solely on the grounds set out in subdivision (d) of the rule. Objections of the type listed in subdivision (d) often can be resolved without material factual or legal disputes. Objections to multiple claims permitted under the rule must comply with the procedural requirements set forth in subdivision (e). Among those requirements is the requirement in subdivision (e)(5) that these omnibus objections be consecutively numbered. Since these objections may not join more than 100 objections in any one omnibus objection, there may be a need for several omnibus objections to be filed in a particular case. Consecutive numbering of each omnibus objection and the identification of the objector in the title of the objection is essential to keep track of the objections on the court’s docket. For example, the objections could be titled Debtor in Possession’s First Omnibus Objection to Claims, Debtor in Possession’s Second Omnibus Objection to Claims, Creditors’ Committee’s First Omnibus Objection to Claims, and so on. Titling the objections in this manner should avoid confusion and aid in tracking the objections on the docket.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) provides that an order resolving an objection to any particular claim is treated, for purposes of finality, as if the claim had been the subject of an individual objection. A party seeking to appeal any such order is neither required, nor permitted, to await the court’s resolution of all other joined objections. The rule permits the joinder of objections for convenience, and that convenience should not impede timely review of a court’s decision with respect to each claim. Whether the court’s action as to a particular objection is final, and the consequences of that finality, are not addressed by this amendment. Moreover, use of an omnibus objection generally does not preclude the objecting party from raising a subsequent objection to the claim on other grounds. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 26(1)(d) (1982) (generally applicable rule barring multiple actions based on same transaction or series of transactions is overridden when a statutory scheme permits splitting of claims).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. There were several changes made to the rule after its publication. The Advisory Committee declined to follow Mr. Sabino’s suggestion, concluding that the rule as proposed includes sufficient flexibility, and that expanding the flexibility might lead to excessive deviation from the appropriate format for omnibus claims objections. The Advisory Committee also declined to follow Mr. Horsley’s suggestion because the deadline for filing a proof of claim varies based on the nature of the creditor (governmental units have different deadlines from other creditors) as well as on the chapter under which the case is pending. The Advisory Committee rejected Judge Grant’s suggestion that a party proposing an omnibus claims objection be required to demonstrate some special cause to allow the joinder of the objections. The Advisory Committee concluded that the rule includes sufficient protections for claimants such that omnibus objections should be allowed without the need for a special showing by the claims objector that joinder is proper.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Advisory Committee did accept several of Judge Grant’s suggestions, and the rule was amended by deleting the grounds for objection to claims based on the filing of a superceding proof of claim under proposed subdivision (d)(3) and the transfer of claims under proposed subdivision (d)(4). Subdivision (d)(3) now permits objections to claims that have been amended by a subsequently filed proof of claim and the paragraphs within subdivision (d) have been renumbered to reflect the deletion. The Committee Note also no longer includes any reliance on § 502(j) for the statement indicating that a subsequent claim objection can be filed to a claim that was previously included in an omnibus claim objection.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b663aa6-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2017 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) is amended to specify the manner in which an objection to a claim and notice of the objection must be served. It clarifies that Rule 7004 does not apply to the service of most claim objections. Instead, a claimant must be served by first-class mail addressed to the person whom the claimant most recently designated on its proof of claim to receive notices, at the address so indicated. If, however, the claimant is the United States, an officer or agency of the United States, or an insured depository institution, service must also be made according to the method prescribed by the appropriate provision of Rule 7004. The service methods for the depository institutions are statutorily mandated, and the size and dispersal of the decision-making and litigation authority of the federal government necessitate service on the appropriate United States attorney’s office and the Attorney General, as well as the person designated on the proof of claim.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As amended, subdivision (a) no longer requires that a hearing be scheduled or held on every objection. The rule requires the objecting party to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the objection, but, by deleting from the subdivision references to “the hearing,” it permits local practices that require a claimant to timely request a hearing or file a response in order to obtain a hearing. The official notice form served with a copy of the objection will inform the claimant of any actions it must take. However, while a local rule may require the claimant to respond to the objection to a proof of claim, the court will still need to determine if the claim is valid, even if the claimant does not file a response to a claim objection or request a hearing.</p>

Rule 7004(h) was enacted by Congress as part of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. It applies only to insured depository institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and does not include credit unions, which are instead insured by the National Credit Union Administration. A credit union, therefore, may be served with an objection to a claim according to Rule 3007(a)(2)(A)—by first-class mail sent to the person designated for receipt of notice on the credit union’s proof of claim.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b663aad-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 502(j) of the Code deals only with the reconsideration of allowed claims as did former § 57k of the Act and General Order 21(b). It had sometimes been held that a referee had no jurisdiction to reconsider a disallowed claim, or the amount or priority of an allowed claim, at the instance of the claimant. See, <i>e.g., In re Gouse</i>, 7 F. Supp. 106 (M.D. Pa. 1934); <i>In re Tomlinson &amp; Dye, Inc</i>., 3 F. Supp. 800 (N.D. Okla. 1933). This view disregarded § 2a(2) of the Act and the “ancient and elementary power” of a referee as a court to reconsider orders. <i>In re Pottasch Brow. Co., Inc</i>., 79 F.2d 613, 616 (2d Cir. 1935); <i>Castaner v. Mora</i>, 234 F.2d 710 (1st Cir. 1956). This rule recognizes, as did former Bankruptcy Rule 307, the power of the court to reconsider an order of disallowance on appropriate motion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reconsideration of a claim that has been previously allowed or disallowed after objection is discretionary with the court. The right to seek reconsideration of an allowed claim, like the right to object to its allowance, is generally exercised by the trustee if one has qualified and is performing the duties of that office with reasonable diligence and fidelity. A request for reconsideration of a disallowance would, on the other hand, ordinarily come from the claimant.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with the rules in this Part III is prima facie evidence of the validity and the amount of the claim notwithstanding a motion for reconsideration of an order of allowance. Failure to respond does not constitute an admission, though it may be deemed a consent to a reconsideration. <i>In re Goble Boat Co</i>., 190 Fed. 92 (N.D.N.Y. 1911). The court may decline to reconsider an order of allowance or disallowance without notice to any adverse party and without affording any hearing to the movant. If a motion to reconsider is granted, notice and hearing must be afforded to parties in interest before the previous action in the claim taken in respect to the claim may be vacated or modified. After reconsideration, the court may allow or disallow the claim, increase or decrease the amount of a prior allowance, accord the claim a priority different from that originally assigned it, or enter any other appropriate order.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule expands § 502(j) which provides for reconsideration of an allowance only before the case is closed. Authorities have disagreed as to whether reconsideration may be had after a case has been reopened. Compare 3 Collier <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶57.23[4] (14th ed. 1964), see generally 3 <i>id</i>. ¶502.10 (15th ed. 1979), with 2 Remington, <i>Bankruptcy</i> 498 (Henderson ed. 1956). If a case is reopened as provided in § 350(b) of the Code, reconsideration of the allowance or disallowance of a claim may be sought and granted in accordance with this rule.</p>

The preparation of records showing dividends declared and to whom payable is subject to prescription by the Director of the Administrative Office pursuant to Rule 5003(e). The rule governs distributions to creditors having priority as well as to general unsecured creditors. Notwithstanding the detailed statutory provisions regulating the declaration of dividends, a necessarily wide discretion over this matter has been recognized to reside in the court. See 3A Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶65.03 (14th ed. 1975): 1 <i>Proceedings of Seminar for Newly Appointed Referees in Bankruptcy</i> 173 (1964). Although the rule leaves to the discretion of the court the amount and the times of dividend payments, it recognizes the creditors’ right to as prompt payment as practicable.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The second and third sentences of the rule make explicit the method of payment of dividends and afford protection of the interests of the creditor and the holder of a power of attorney authorized to receive payment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule does not permit variance at local option. This represents a marked change from former Bankruptcy Rule 308.</p>

When the trustee deposits undistributed dividends pursuant to a direction in accordance with this rule the trustee should file with the clerk a list of the names and addresses, so far as known, of the persons entitled to the money so deposited and the respective amounts payable to them pursuant to Rule 3011.

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b68aae6-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pursuant to § 1111(b)(1) of the Code, a nonrecourse secured loan is converted, automatically, into a recourse loan thereby entitling the creditor to an unsecured deficiency claim if the value of the collateral is less than the debt. The class, however, may retain the loan as a nonrecourse loan by electing application of § 1111(b)(2) by the majorities stated in § 1111(b)(1)(A)(i). That section does not specify any time periods for making the election.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 3014 provides that if no agreement is negotiated, the election of § 1111(b)(2) of the Code may be made at any time prior to conclusion of the hearing on the disclosure statement. Once the hearing has been concluded, it would be too late for a secured creditor class to demand different treatment unless the court has fixed a later time. This would be the case if, for example, a public class of secured creditors should have an approved disclosure statement prior to electing under § 1111(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Generally it is important that the proponent of a plan ascertain the position of the secured creditor class before a plan is proposed. The secured creditor class must know the prospects of its treatment under the plan before it can intelligently determine its rights under § 1111(b). The rule recognizes that there may be negotiations between the proponent of the plan and the secured creditor leading to a representation of desired treatment under § 1111(b). If that treatment is approved by the requisite majorities of the class and culminates in a written, signed statement filed with the court, that statement becomes binding and the class may not thereafter demand different treatment under § 1111(b) with respect to that plan. The proponent of the plan is thus enabled to seek approval of the disclosure statement and transmit the plan for voting in anticipation of confirmation. Only if that plan is not confirmed may the class of secured creditors thereafter change its prior election.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While this rule and the Code refer to a class of secured creditors it should be noted that ordinarily each secured creditor is in a separate and distinct class. In that event, the secured creditor has the sole power to determine application of § 1111(b) with respect to that claim.</p>

The rule permits a summary of the plan to be transmitted with the notice of the hearing on confirmation. The court may, however, require the plan itself to be transmitted and the debtor to supply enough copies for this purpose. In the former rules under Chapter XIII the plan would accompany the notice of the first meeting of creditors. It is more important for the plan or a summary of its terms to be sent with the notice of the confirmation hearing. At that hearing objections to the plan will be heard by the court.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is amended to require use of an Official Form if one is adopted for chapter 13 plans unless a Local Form has been adopted consistent with Rule 3015.1. Subdivision (c) also provides that nonstandard provisions in a chapter 13 plan must be set out in the section of the Official or Local Form specifically designated for such provisions and must be identified in the manner required by the Official or Local Form.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) is amended to ensure that the trustee and creditors are served with the plan before confirmation. Service may be made either at the time the plan is filed or with the notice under Rule 2002 of the hearing to consider confirmation of the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) is amended to require service of an objection to confirmation at least seven days before the hearing to consider confirmation of a plan, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (g) is amended to set out two effects of confirmation. Subdivision (g)(1) provides that the amount of a secured claim under § 506(a) may be determined through a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan in accordance with Rule 3012. That determination, unlike the amount of any current installment payments or arrearages, controls over a contrary proof of claim, without the need for a claim objection under Rule 3007, and over the schedule submitted by the debtor under § 521(a). The amount of a secured claim of a governmental unit, however, may not be determined through a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan under Rule 3012. Subdivision (g)(2) provides for termination of the automatic stay under §§ 362, 1201, and 1301 as requested in the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (h) was formerly subdivision (g). It is redesignated and is amended to reflect that often the party proposing a plan modification is responsible for serving the proposed modification on other parties. The option to serve a summary of the proposed modification has been retained. Unless required by another rule, service under this subdivision does not need to be made in the manner provided for service of a summons and complaint by Rule 7004.</p>

It sets out features required for all Local Forms for plans in chapter 13 cases. If a Local Form does not comply with this rule, it may not be used in lieu of the Official Chapter 13 Plan Form. See Rule 3015(c).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the rule only one Local Form may be adopted in a district. The rule does not specify the method of adoption, but it does require that adoption of a Local Form be preceded by a public notice and comment period.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To promote consistency among Local Forms and clarity of content of chapter 13 plans, the rule prescribes several formatting and disclosure requirements. Paragraphs in such a form must be numbered and labeled in bold type, and the form must contain separate paragraphs for the cure and maintenance of home mortgages, payment of domestic support obligations, treatment of secured claims covered by the “hanging paragraph” of § 1325(a), and surrender of property securing a claim. Whether those portions of the Local Form are used in a given chapter 13 case will depend on the debtor’s individual circumstances.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule requires that a Local Form begin with a paragraph for the debtor to call attention to the fact that the plan contains a nonstandard provision; limits the amount of a secured claim based on a valuation of the collateral, as authorized by Rule 3012(b); or avoids a lien, as authorized by Rule 4003(d).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The last paragraph of a Local Form must be for the inclusion of any nonstandard provisions, as defined by Rule 3015(c), and must include a statement that nonstandard provisions placed elsewhere in the plan are void. This part gives the debtor the opportunity to propose provisions that are not otherwise in, or that deviate from, the Local Form. The form must also require a certification by the debtor’s attorney or unrepresented debtor that there are no nonstandard provisions other than those placed in the final paragraph.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b68ab28-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule implements the Code provisions concerning the filing of plans in chapters 9 and 11.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Chapter 9 Cases</i>. Section 941 provides that the debtor may file a plan with the petition or thereafter but within a time fixed by the court. A rule, therefore, is unnecessary to specify the time for filing chapter 9 plans.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Chapter 11 Nonrailroad Cases</i>. Section 1121 contains detailed provisions with respect to who may file a chapter 11 plan and, in part, the time period. Section 1121(a) permits a debtor to file a plan with the petition or at any time during the case. Section 1121(b) and (c) grants exclusive periods of 120 days and 180 days for the debtor to file and obtain acceptance of a plan. Failure to take advantage of these periods or the appointment of a trustee would permit other parties in interest to file a plan. These statutory provisions are not repeated in the rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Chapter 11 Railroad Cases</i>. Pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter 11, § 1121 of the Code is applicable in railroad cases; see §§ 1161, 103(g). A trustee, however, is to be appointed in every case; thus, pursuant to § 1121(c), any party in interest may file a plan. See discussion of subdivision (a) of this rule, <i>infra.</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. Section 1121(c), while permitting parties in interest a limited right to file plans, does not provide any time limitation. This subdivision sets as the deadline, the conclusion of the hearing on the disclosure statement. The court may, however, grant additional time. It is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10–301(c)(2) which used, as the cut-off time, the conclusion of the hearing on approval of a plan. As indicated, <i>supra</i>, § 1121(a) permits a debtor to file a plan at any time during the chapter 11 case. Under § 1121(c), parties other than a debtor may file a plan only after a trustee is appointed or the debtor’s exclusive time expires.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> requires plans to be properly identified.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. This provision is new. In chapter 9 and 11 cases (including railroad reorganization cases) postpetition solicitation of votes on a plan requires transmittal of a disclosure statement, the contents of which have been approved by the court. See § 1125 of the Code. A prepetition solicitation must either have been in conformity with applicable nonbankruptcy law or, if none, the disclosure must have been of adequate information as set forth in § 1125 of the Code. See § 1126(b). Subdivision (c) of this rule provides the time for filing the disclosure statement or evidence of compliance with § 1126(b) which ordinarily will be with the plan but the court may allow a later time or the court may, pursuant to the last sentence, fix a time certain. Rule 3017 deals with the hearing on the disclosure statement. The disclosure statement, pursuant to § 1125 is to contain adequate information. “Adequate information” is defined in § 1125(a) as information that would permit a reasonable creditor or equity security holder to make an informed judgment on the plan.</p>

A party in interest may not file a plan without leave of court only if an order approving a disclosure statement relating to another plan has been entered and a decision on confirmation of the plan has not been entered. This subdivision does not fix a deadline beyond which a debtor may not file a plan.</p>

Under § 1121(d), the exclusive period in which only the debtor may file a plan may be extended, but only if a party in interest so requests and the court, after notice and a hearing, finds cause for an extension. Subdivision (a) is abrogated because it could have the effect of extending the debtor’s exclusive period for filing a plan without satisfying the requirements of § 1121(d). The abrogation of subdivision (a) does not affect the court’s discretion with respect to the scheduling of hearings on the approval of disclosure statements when more than one plan has been filed.</p>

The validity and effect of any injunction are substantive law matters that are beyond the scope of these rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Specific and conspicuous language is not necessary if the injunction contained in the plan is substantially the same as an injunction provided under the Code. For example, if a plan contains an injunction against acts to collect a discharged debt from the debtor, Rule 3016(c) would not apply because that conduct would be enjoined nonetheless under § 524(a)(2). But if a plan provides that creditors will be permanently enjoined from asserting claims against persons who are not debtors in the case, the plan and disclosure statement must highlight the injunctive language and comply with the requirements of Rule 3016(c). <i>See</i> § 524(e).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The requirement in this rule that the plan and disclosure statement identify the entities that would be subject to the injunction requires reasonable identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would be subject to the injunction cannot be identified by name, the plan and disclosure statement may describe them by class or category. For example, it may be sufficient to identify the subjects of the injunction as “all creditors of the debtor.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</i>. The word “highlighted” in the parenthesis was replaced with “underlined” because highlighted documents are difficult to scan electronically for inclusion in the clerks’ files. The Committee Note was revised to put in a more prominent position the statement that the validity and effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive matters beyond the scope of the rules. Other stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note.</p>

If the plan is intended to provide adequate information in a small business case, it may be conditionally approved as a disclosure statement under Rule 3017.1 and is subject to all other rules applicable to disclosure statements in small business cases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) is added to the rule to implement § 433 of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 which requires the promulgation of Official Forms for plans and disclosure statements in small business cases. Section 1125(f)(2) of the Code provides that the court may approve a disclosure statement submitted on the appropriate Official Form or on a standard form approved by the court.

L. No. 116–54, <ref href="/us/stat/133/1079">133 Stat. 1079</ref>. That law gives a small business debtor the option of electing to be a debtor under subchapter V of chapter 11. Subdivision (b) of the rule is amended to reflect that under § 1181(b) of the Code, § 1125 does not apply to subchapter V cases (and thus a disclosure statement is not required) unless the court for cause orders otherwise. Subdivision (d) is amended to include subchapter V cases as ones in which Official Forms are available for a reorganization plan and, when required, a disclosure statement.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b68ab54-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is adapted from former Rule 10–303 which dealt with the approval of a Chapter X plan by the court. There is no requirement for plan approval in a chapter 9 or 11 case under the Code but there is the requirement that a disclosure statement containing adequate financial information be approved by the court after notice and a hearing before votes on a plan are solicited. Section 1125(b) of the Code is made applicable in chapter 9 cases by § 901(a). It is also applicable in railroad reorganization cases under subchapter IV of chapter 11; see § 1161 of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> of this rule provides for the hearing on the disclosure statement. Thus, a hearing would be required in all cases; whether it may be ex parte would depend on the circumstances of the case, but a mere absence of objections would not eliminate the need for a hearing; see § 102(1) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">No provision similar to former Rule 10–303(f) is included. That subdivision together with former Rule 10–304 prohibited solicitation of votes until after entry of an order approving the plan. Section 1125(b) of the Code explicitly provides that votes on a plan may not be solicited until a disclosure statement approved by the court is transmitted. Pursuant to the change in rulemaking power, a comparable provision in this rule is unnecessary. 28 U.S.C. § 2075.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Copies of the disclosure statement and plan need not be mailed with the notice of the hearing or otherwise transmitted prior to the hearing except with respect to the parties explicitly set forth in the subdivision.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It should be noted that, by construction, the singular includes the plural. Therefore, the phrase “plan or plans” or “disclosure statement or statements” has not been used although the possibility of multiple plans and statements is recognized.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> permits the court to require a party other than the clerk of the bankruptcy court to bear the responsibility for transmitting the notices and documents specified in the rule when votes on the plan are solicited. Ordinarily the person responsible for such mailing will be the proponent of the plan. In rare cases the clerk may be directed to mail these documents, particularly when the trustee would have the responsibility but there is insufficient money in the estate to enable the trustee to perform this task.</p>

Section 1125(c) of the Code requires that the entire approved disclosure statement be provided in connection with voting on a plan. The court is authorized by § 1125(c) to approve different disclosure statements for different classes. Although the rule does not permit the mailing of a summary of the disclosure statement in place of the approved disclosure statement, the court may approve a summary of the disclosure statement to be mailed with the complete disclosure statement to those voting on the plan.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b68ab56-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to monitor and comment with regard to chapter 11 disclosure statements and plans. The United States trustee does not perform these functions in a chapter 9 municipal debt adjustment case. See 28 U.S.C. § 586(a)(3)(B).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is amended to give the court the discretion to direct that one or more unimpaired classes shall not receive disclosure statements, plans, or summaries of plans. Members of unimpaired classes are not entitled to vote on the plan. Although disclosure statements enable members of unimpaired classes to make informed judgments as to whether to object to confirmation because of lack of feasibility or other grounds, in an unusual case the court may direct that disclosure statements shall not be sent to such classes if to do so would not be feasible considering the size of the unimpaired classes and the expense of printing and mailing. In any event, all creditors are entitled to notice of the time fixed for filing objections and notice of the hearing to consider confirmation of the plan pursuant to Rule 2002(b) and the requirement of such notice may not be excused with respect to unimpaired classes. The amendment to subdivision (d) also ensures that the members of unimpaired classes who do not receive such documents will have sufficient information so that they may request these documents in advance of the hearing on confirmation. The amendment to subdivision (d) is not intended to give the court the discretion to dispense with the mailing of the plan and disclosure statement to governmental units holding claims entitled to priority under § 507(a)(7) because they may not be classified. See § 1123(a)(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The words “with the court” in subdivision (a) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3). Reference to the Official Form number in subdivision (d) is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> is designed to ensure that appropriate measures are taken for the plan, disclosure statement, ballot and other materials which are required to be transmitted to creditors and equity security holders under this rule to reach the beneficial holders of securities held in nominee name. Such measures may include orders directing the trustee or debtor in possession to reimburse the nominees out of the funds of the estate for the expenses incurred by them in distributing materials to beneficial holders. In most cases, the plan proponent will not know the identities of the beneficial holders and therefore it will be necessary to rely on the nominal holders of the securities to distribute the plan materials to the beneficial owners.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is amended to provide flexibility in fixing the record date for the purpose of determining the holders of securities who are entitled to receive documents pursuant to this subdivision. For example, if there may be a delay between the oral announcement of the judge’s order approving the disclosure statement and entry of the order on the court docket, the court may fix the date on which the judge orally approves the disclosure statement as the record date so that the parties may expedite preparation of the lists necessary to facilitate the distribution of the plan, disclosure statement, ballots, and other related documents.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The court may set a record date pursuant to subdivision (d) only after notice and a hearing as provided in § 102(1) of the Code. Notice of a request for an order fixing the record date may be included in the notice of the hearing to consider approval of the disclosure statement mailed pursuant to Rule 2002(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If the court fixes a record date pursuant to subdivision (d) with respect to the holders of securities, and the holders are impaired by the plan, the judge also should order that the same record date applies for the purpose of determining eligibility for voting pursuant to Rule 3018(a).</p>

It does not address any substantive law issues relating to the validity or effect of any injunction provided under a plan, or any due process or other constitutional issues relating to notice. These issues are beyond the scope of these rules and are left for judicial determination.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule recognizes the need for adequate notice to subjects of an injunction, but that reasonable flexibility under the circumstances may be required. If a known and identifiable entity would be subject to the injunction, and the notice, plan, and disclosure statement could be mailed to that entity, the court should require that they be mailed at the same time that the plan, disclosure statement and related documents are mailed to creditors under Rule 3017(d). If mailing notices and other documents is not feasible because the entities subject to the injunction are described in the plan and disclosure statement by class or category and they cannot be identified individually by name and address, the court may require that notice under Rule 3017(f)(1) be published.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6af581-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule applies in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases under the Code. The references in the rule to equity security holders will not, however, be relevant in chapter 9 or 13 cases. The rule will be of little utility in a chapter 13 case because only secured creditors may be requested to vote on a plan; unsecured creditors are not entitled to vote; see § 1325(a)(4), (5) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> is derived from former Rule 10–305(a). It substitutes, in a reorganization case, entry of the order approving the disclosure statement for the order approving a plan in conformity with the differences between Chapter X and chapter 11. In keeping with the underlying theory it continues to recognize that the lapse of time between the filing of the petition and entry of such order will normally be significant and, during that interim, bonds and equity interests can change ownership.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> recognizes the former Chapter XI practice permitting a plan and acceptances to be filed with the petition, as does § 1126(b) of the Code. However, because a plan under chapter 11 may affect shareholder interests, there should be reference to a record date of ownership. In this instance the appropriate record date is that used in the prepetition solicitation materials because it is those acceptances or rejections which are being submitted to the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While § 1126(c), (d), and (e) prohibits use of an acceptance or rejection not procured in good faith, the added provision in subdivision (b) of the rule is somewhat more detailed. It would prohibit use of prepetition acceptances or rejections when some but not all impaired creditors or equity security holders are solicited or when they are not given a reasonable opportunity to submit their acceptances or rejections. This provision together with § 1126(e) gives the court the power to nullify abusive solicitation procedures.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. It is possible that multiple plans may be before the court for confirmation. Pursuant to § 1129(c) of the Code, the court may confirm only one plan but is required to consider the preferences expressed by those accepting the plans in determining which one to confirm.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivisions (d) and (e) of former Rule 10–305 are not continued since comparable provisions are contained in the statute; see § 1126(c), (d), (e).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It should be noted that while the singular “plan” is used throughout, by construction the plural is included; see § 102(7).</p>

An entity who is not a record holder of a security, but who claims that it is entitled to be treated as a record holder, may file a statement pursuant to Rule 3003(d).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> is amended further to allow the court to permit a creditor or equity security holder to change or withdraw an acceptance or rejection for cause shown whether or not the time fixed for voting has expired.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is also amended to give effect to a prepetition acceptance or rejection if solicitation requirements were satisfied with respect to substantially all members of the same class, instead of requiring proper solicitation with respect to substantially all members of all classes.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The court may set a record date pursuant to subdivision (a) only after notice and a hearing as provided in § 102(1) of the Code.

It applies to cases filed under chapters 9, 11 and 13. Certain subdivisions of the earlier rules have not been included, such as, a subdivision revesting title in the debtor because § 541 of the Code does not transfer title out of the debtor as did § 70a of the Bankruptcy Act; see also §§ 1141(b), 1327(b). Subdivision (b) of former Rule 13–213 is not included because its provisions are contained in the statute; see §§ 1322, 1325(b), 105.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> gives discretion to the court to require in chapter 11 cases the deposit of any consideration to be distributed on confirmation. If money is to be distributed, it is to be deposited in a special account to assure that it will not be used for any other purpose. The Code is silent in chapter 11 with respect to the need to make a deposit or the person with whom any deposit is to be made. Consequently, there is no statutory authority for any person to act in a capacity similar to the disbursing agent under former Chapter XI practice. This rule provides that only the debtor in possession or trustee should be appointed as the recipient of the deposit. Any consideration other than money, <i>e.g</i>., notes or stock may be given directly to the debtor in possession or trustee and need not be left in any kind of special account. In chapter 9 cases, § 944(b) provides for deposit with a disbursing agent appointed by the court of any consideration to be distributed under the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> clarifies the authority of the court to conclude matters pending before it prior to confirmation and to continue to administer the estate as necessary, <i>e.g</i>., resolving objections to claims.</p>

See 28 U.S.C. § 586(a)(3). The amendments to subdivisions (b)(1) and (c) of this rule facilitate that role of the United States trustee. Subdivision (b)(1) is also amended to require service on the proponent of the plan of objections to confirmation. The words “with the court” in subdivision (b)(1) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In a chapter 12 case, the court is required to conduct and conclude the hearing on confirmation of the plan within the time prescribed in § 1224 of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> is also amended to require that the confirmation order be mailed to the trustee. Reference to the Official Form number is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>

Unless the court orders otherwise, any transfer of assets, issuance of securities, and cash distributions provided for in the plan may not be made before the expiration of the 10-day period. The stay of the confirmation order under subdivision (e) does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal from the confirmation order in accordance with Rule 8002.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 3020(e) is not applicable so that the plan may be implemented and distributions may be made immediately. Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule 3020(e) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.</p>

This requirement is not applicable to an injunction contained in a plan if it is substantially the same as an injunction provided under the Code. The validity and effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive law matters that are beyond the scope of these rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The requirement that the order of confirmation identify the entities subject to the injunction requires only reasonable identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would be subject to the injunction cannot be identified by name, the order may describe them by class or category if reasonable under the circumstances. For example, it may be sufficient to identify the entities as “all creditors of the debtor.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</i>. No changes were made in the text of the proposed amendments.

Factors that the court should consider in determining whether the estate has been fully administered include (1) whether the order confirming the plan has become final, (2) whether deposits required by the plan have been distributed, (3) whether the property proposed by the plan to be transferred has been transferred, (4) whether the debtor or the successor of the debtor under the plan has assumed the business or the management of the property dealt with by the plan, (5) whether payments under the plan have commenced, and (6) whether all motions, contested matters, and adversary proceedings have been finally resolved.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The court should not keep the case open only because of the possibility that the court’s jurisdiction may be invoked in the future. A final decree closing the case after the estate is fully administered does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to enforce or interpret its own orders and does not prevent the court from reopening the case for cause pursuant to § 350(b) of the Code. For example, on motion of a party in interest, the court may reopen the case to revoke an order of confirmation procured by fraud under § 1144 of the Code. If the plan or confirmation order provides that the case shall remain open until a certain date or event because of the likelihood that the court’s jurisdiction may be required for specific purposes prior thereto, the case should remain open until that date or event.</p>

<notes type="uscNote" id="id1b6d65fe-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba">
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6d65ff-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule implements § 362 of the Code which set forth provisions regarding the automatic stay that arises on the filing of a petition. That section and this rule are applicable in chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 cases. It also implements § 363(c)(2) concerning use of cash collateral.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> transforms with respect to the automatic stay what was an adversary proceeding under the former rules to motion practice. The Code provides automatic stays in several sections, <i>e.g</i>., §§ 362(a), 1301(a), and in § 362(d) provides some grounds for relief from the stay. This rule specifies that the pleading seeking relief is by means of a motion. Thus the time period in Rule 7012 to answer a complaint would not be applicable and shorter periods may be fixed. Section 362(e) requires the preliminary hearing to be concluded within 30 days of it inception, rendering ordinary complaint and answer practice inappropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This subdivision also makes clear that a motion under Rule 9014 is the proper procedure for a debtor to seek court permission to use cash collateral. See § 363(c)(2). Pursuant to Rule 5005, the motion should be filed in the court in which the case in pending. The court or local rule may specify the persons to be served with the motion for relief from the stay; see Rule 9013.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> of the rule fills a procedural void left by § 362. Pursuant to § 362(e), the automatic stay is terminated 30 days after a motion for relief is made unless the court continues the stay as a result of a final hearing or, pending final hearing, after a preliminary hearing. If a preliminary hearing is held, § 362(e) requires the final hearing to be commenced within 30 days after the preliminary hearing. Although the expressed legislative intent is to require expeditious resolution of a secured party’s motion for relief, § 362 is silent as to the time within which the final hearing must be concluded. Subdivision (b) imposes a 30 day deadline on the court to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At the final hearing, the stay is to be terminated, modified, annulled, or conditioned for cause, which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, lack of adequate protection; § 362(d). The burden of proving adequate protection is on the party opposing relief from the stay; § 362(g)(2). Adequate protection is exemplified in § 361.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> implements § 362(f) which permits ex parte relief from the stay when there will be irreparable damage. This subdivision sets forth the procedure to be followed when relief is sought under § 362(f). It is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 601(d).</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6d6600-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The scope of this rule is expanded and the former subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) are now combined in subdivision (a). The new subdivision (a)(2) is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to § 362(e) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> deals explicitly with the procedures which follow after a motion to use cash collateral is made and served. Filing shall be pursuant to Rule 5005. Service of the motion may be made by any method authorized by Rule 7004 and, if service is by mail, service is complete on mailing. Rule 9006(e). Under subdivision (b)(2), the court may commence a final hearing on the motion within 15 days of service. Rule 9006(f) does not extend this 15 day period when service of the motion is by mail because the party served is not required to act within the 15 day period. In addition to service of the motion, notice of the hearing must be given. Rule 9007 authorizes the court to direct the form and manner of giving notice that is appropriate to the circumstances.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 363(c)(3) authorizes the court to conduct a preliminary hearing and to authorize the use of cash collateral “if there is a reasonable likelihood that the trustee will prevail at a final hearing.” Subdivision (b)(2) of the rule permits a preliminary hearing to be held earlier than 15 days after service. Any order authorizing the use of cash collateral shall be limited to the amount necessary to protect the estate until a final hearing is held.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The objective of subdivision (b) is to accommodate both the immediate need of the debtor and the interest of the secured creditor in the cash collateral. The time for holding the final hearing may be enlarged beyond the 15 days prescribed when required by the circumstances.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The motion for authority to use cash collateral shall include (1) the amount of cash collateral sought to be used; (2) the name and address of each entity having an interest in the cash collateral; (3) the name and address of the entity in control or having possession of the cash collateral; (4) the facts demonstrating the need to use the cash collateral; and (5) the nature of the protection to be provided those having an interest in the cash collateral. If a preliminary hearing is requested, the motion shall also include the amount of cash collateral sought to be used pending final hearing and the protection to be provided.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Notice of the preliminary and final hearings may be combined. This rule does not limit the authority of the court under § 363(c)(2)(B) and § 102(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> is new. The service, hearing, and notice requirements are similar to those imposed by subdivision (b). The motion to obtain credit shall include the amount and type of the credit to be extended, the name and address of the lender, the terms of the agreement, the need to obtain the credit, and the efforts made to obtain credit from other sources. If the motion is to obtain credit pursuant to § 364(c) or (d), the motion shall describe the collateral, if any, and the protection for any existing interest in the collateral which may be affected by the proposed agreement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is new. In the event the 15 day period for filing objections to the approval of an agreement of the parties described in this subdivision is too long, the parties either may move for a reduction of the period under Rule 9006(c)(1) or proceed under subdivision (b) or (c), if applicable. Rule 9006(c)(1) requires that cause be shown for the reduction of the period in which to object. In applying this criterion the court may consider the option of proceeding under subdivision (b) or (c) and grant a preliminary hearing and relief pending final hearing.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Notice of the motion for relief from the automatic stay or to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of property must be served on the entities entitled to receive notice of a motion to approve an agreement pursuant to subdivision (d). If the movant and the adverse party agree to settle the motion and the terms of the agreement do not materially differ from the terms set forth in the movant’s motion papers, the court may approve the agreement without further notice pursuant to subdivision (d)(4).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(2)</i> is deleted as unnecessary because of § 362(e) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1)</i> are amended to require service on committees that are elected in chapter 7 cases. Service on committees of retired employees appointed under § 1114 of the Code is not required. These subdivisions are amended further to clarify that, in the absence of a creditors’ committee, service on the creditors included on the list filed pursuant to Rule 1007(d) is required only in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. The other amendments to subdivision (d)(1) are for consistency of style and are not substantive.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)(4)</i> is added to avoid the necessity of further notice and delay for the approval of an agreement in settlement of a motion for relief from an automatic stay, to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of property, for use of cash collateral, or for authority to obtain credit if the entities entitled to notice have already received sufficient notice of the scope of the proposed agreement in the motion papers and have had an opportunity to be heard. For example, if a trustee makes a motion to use cash collateral and proposes in the original motion papers to provide adequate protection of the interest of the secured party by granting a lien on certain equipment, and the secured creditor subsequently agrees to terms that are within the scope of those proposed in the motion, the court may enter an order approving the agreement without further notice if the entities that received the original motion papers have had a reasonable opportunity to object to the granting of the motion to use cash collateral.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If the motion papers served under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) do not afford notice sufficient to inform the recipients of the material provisions of the proposed agreement and opportunity for a hearing, approval of the settlement agreement may not be obtained unless the procedural requirements of subdivision (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) are satisfied. If the 15 day period for filing objections to the approval of the settlement agreement is too long under the particular circumstances of the case, the court may shorten the time for cause under Rule 9006(c)(1).</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The stay of the order does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 4001(a)(3) is not applicable so that the prevailing party may immediately enforce and implement the order granting relief from the automatic stay.

The motion must either not exceed five pages in length, or, if it is longer, begin with a concise statement of five pages or less, that summarizes or lists the material provisions and which will assist the court and interested parties in understanding the nature of the relief requested. The concise statement must also set out the location within the documents of the summarized or listed provisions. The parties to agreements and lending offers frequently have concise summaries of their transactions that contain a list of the material provisions of the agreements, even if the agreements themselves are very lengthy. A similar summary should allow the court and interested parties to understand the relief requested.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to the concise statement, the rule requires that motions under subdivisions (c) and (d) state whether the movant is seeking approval of any of the provisions listed in subdivision (c)(1)(B), and where those provisions are located in the documents. The rule is intended to enhance the ability of the court and interested parties to find and evaluate those provisions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule also provides that any motion for authority to obtain credit must identify any provision listed in subdivision (c)(1)(B)(i)–(xi) that is proposed to remain effective if the court grants the motion on an interim basis under Rule 4001(c)(2), but later denies final relief.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Other amendments are stylistic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">1. The introductory language in subdivisions (b)(1)(B), (c)(1)(B), and (d)(1)(B) was revised to clarify that the motions filed under the rule can be either no more than five pages long or begin with a concise statement of that length. This permits the continued use of forms that have been effective in smaller cases. Subdivision (c)(1)(B) also is amended to require that the motion identify any provisionally approved term that would remain in effect even if the court denies the permanent relief requested.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">2. A new subparagraph (c)(1)(B)(vi) was inserted into the rule and the remaining subparagraphs were renumbered accordingly. The new subparagraph requires that the motion identify any provisions setting deadlines for filing and confirming reorganization plans and disclosure statements.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">3. Subdivisions (c)(1)(C) and (d)(1)(C) of the proposed rule were deleted as unnecessary. The court has whatever authority Rule 9024 provides, and making an explicit reference to that rule in these subdivisions brings unnecessary attention to Rule 9024 and could create a different standard of review under that rule than would apply in other instances. The Advisory Committee did not intend either consequence, so the subdivisions were deleted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">4. Subdivision (d)(1)(A) was restyled to form a vertical list of the motions subject to that provision.</p>

These Code amendments expressly require the debtor to file with the court, or provide to the trustee, specific documents. The amendments to the rule implement these obligations and establish a time frame for creditors to make requests for a copy of the debtor’s Federal income tax return. The rule also requires the debtor to provide documentation in support of claimed expenses under § 707(b)(2)(A) and (B).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) of the rule is also amended to require the debtor to cooperate with the trustee by providing materials and documents necessary to assist the trustee in the performance of the trustee’s duties. Nothing in the rule, however, is intended to limit or restrict the debtor’s duties under § 521, or to limit the access of the Attorney General to any information provided by the debtor in the case. Subdivision (b)(2) does not require that the debtor create documents or obtain documents from third parties; rather, the debtor’s obligation is to bring to the meeting of creditors under § 341 the documents which the debtor possesses. Under subdivision (b)(2)(B), the trustee or the United States trustee can instruct debtors that they need not provide the documents described in that subdivision. Under subdivisions (b)(3) and (b)(4), the debtor must obtain and provide copies of tax returns or tax transcripts to the appropriate person, unless no such documents exist. Any written statement that the debtor provides indicating either that documents do not exist or are not in the debtor’s possession must be verified or contain an unsworn declaration as required under Rule 1008.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because the amendment implements the debtor’s duty to cooperate with the trustee, the materials provided to the trustee would not be made available to any other party in interest at the § 341 meeting of creditors other than the Attorney General. Some of the documents may contain otherwise private information that should not be disseminated. For example, pay stubs and financial account statements might include the social-security numbers of the debtor and the debtor’s spouse and dependents, as well as the names of the debtor’s children. The debtor should redact all but the last four digits of all social-security numbers and the names of any minors when they appear in these documents.

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6d6637-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from § 522(1) of the Code and, in part, former Bankruptcy Rule 403. The Code changes the thrust of that rule by making it the burden of the debtor to list his exemptions and the burden of parties in interest to raise objections in the absence of which “the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt;” § 522(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. While § 522(1) refers to a list of property claimed as exempt, the rule incorporates such a list as part of Official Form No. 6, the schedule of the debtor’s assets, rather than requiring a separate list and filing. Rule 1007, to which subdivision (a) refers, requires that schedule to be filed within 15 days after the order for relief, unless the court extends the time.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 522(1) also provides that a dependent of the debtor may file the list if the debtor fails to do so. Subdivision (a) of the rule allows such filing from the expiration of the debtor’s time until 30 days thereafter. Dependent is defined in § 522(a)(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> provides that a proceeding by the debtor, permitted by § 522(f) of the Code, is a contested matter rather than the more formal adversary proceeding. Proceedings within the scope of this subdivision are distinguished from proceedings brought by the trustee to avoid transfers. The latter are classified as adversary proceedings by Rule 7001.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6d6639-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2000 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is amended to permit the court to grant a timely request for an extension of time to file objections to the list of claimed exemptions, whether the court rules on the request before or after the expiration of the 30-day period. The purpose of this amendment is to avoid the harshness of the present rule which has been construed to deprive a bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to grant a timely request for an extension if it has failed to rule on the request within the 30-day period. See <i>In re Laurain</i>, 113 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 1997), <i>Matter of Stoulig</i>, 45 F.3d 957 (5th Cir. 1995), <i>In re Brayshaw</i>, 912 F.2d 1255 (10th Cir. 1990). The amendments clarify that the extension may be granted only for cause. The amendments also conform the rule to § 522(<i>l</i>) of the Code by recognizing that any party in interest may file an objection or request for an extension of time under this rule. Other amendments are stylistic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>GAP Report on Rule 4003(b)</i>. The words “trustee or creditor” were replaced by “party in interest” to conform to § 522(<i>l</i>) of the Bankruptcy Code which permits any party in interest to object to claimed exemptions. Style revisions also were made to the published draft.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6d663a-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2008 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) is rewritten to include four paragraphs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(2) is added to the rule to permit the trustee to object to an exemption at any time up to one year after the closing of the case if the debtor fraudulently claimed the exemption. Extending the deadline for trustees to object to an exemption when the exemption claim has been fraudulently made will permit the court to review and, in proper circumstances, deny improperly claimed exemptions, thereby protecting the legitimate interests of creditors and the bankruptcy estate. However, similar to the deadline set in § 727(e) of the Code for revoking a discharge which was fraudulently obtained, an objection to an exemption that was fraudulently claimed must be filed within one year after the closing of the case. Subdivision (b)(2) extends the objection deadline only for trustees.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b)(3) is added to the rule to reflect the addition of subsection (q) to § 522 of the Code by the 2005 Act. Section 522(q) imposes a $136,875 limit on a state homestead exemption if the debtor has been convicted of a felony or owes a debt arising from certain causes of action. Other revised provisions of the Code, such as § 727(a)(12) and § 1328(h), suggest that the court may consider issues relating to § 522(q) late in the case, and the 30-day period for objections would not be appropriate for this provision.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) is amended to clarify that a creditor with a lien on property that the debtor is attempting to avoid on the grounds that the lien impairs an exemption may raise in defense to the lien avoidance action any objection to the debtor’s claimed exemption. The right to object is limited to an objection to the exemption of the property subject to the lien and for purposes of the lien avoidance action only. The creditor may not object to other exemption claims made by the debtor. Those objections, if any, are governed by Rule 4003(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Other changes are stylistic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. The deadline for filing objections to exemptions under subdivision (b)(1) was returned to 30 days after the conclusion of the § 341 meeting of creditors rather than the 60 day period proposed in the published rule. The second paragraph of the Committee Note which discussed this change was therefore deleted. Subdivisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) were amended to add the debtor and the debtor’s attorney to the list of persons to whom objections to exemptions must be delivered.</p>

A plan that proposes lien avoidance in accordance with this rule must be served as provided under Rule 7004 for service of a summons and complaint.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</i> of this rule prescribe the procedure for determining whether a discharge will be granted pursuant to § 727 of the Code. The time fixed by subdivision (a) may be enlarged as provided in subdivision (b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The notice referred to in subdivision (a) is required to be given by mail and addressed to creditors as provided in Rule 2002.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">An extension granted on a motion pursuant to subdivision (b) of the rule would ordinarily benefit only the movant, but its scope and effect would depend on the terms of the extension.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. If a complaint objecting to discharge is filed, the court’s grant or denial of the discharge will be entered at the conclusion of the proceeding as a judgment in accordance with Rule 9021. The inclusion of the clause in subdivision (c) qualifying the duty of the court to grant a discharge when a waiver has been filed is in accord with the construction of the Code. 4 Collier, <i>Bankruptcy</i> ¶ 727.12 (15th ed. 1979).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The last sentence of subdivision (c) takes cognizance of § 524(c) of the Code which authorizes a debtor to enter into enforceable reaffirmation agreements only prior to entry of the order of discharge. Immediate entry of that order after expiration of the time fixed for filing complaints objecting to discharge may render it more difficult for a debtor to settle pending litigation to determine the dischargeability of a debt and execute a reaffirmation agreement as part of a settlement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. An objection to discharge is required to be made by a complaint, which initiates an adversary proceeding as provided in Rule 7003. Pursuant to Rule 5005, the complaint should be filed in the court in which the case is pending.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. Official Form No. 27 to which subdivision (e) refers, includes notice of the effects of a discharge specified in § 524(a) of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i>. Registration may facilitate the enforcement of the order of discharge in a district other than that in which it was entered. See 2 Moore’s <i>Federal Practice</i> ¶ 1.04[2] (2d ed. 1967). Because of the nationwide service of process authorized by Rule 7004, however, registration of the order of discharge is not necessary under these rules to enable a discharged debtor to obtain relief against a creditor proceeding anywhere in the United States in disregard of the injunctive provisions of the order of discharge.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i>. Notice of discharge should be mailed promptly after the order becomes final so that creditors may be informed of entry of the order and of its injunctive provisions. Rule 2002 specifies the manner of the notice and persons to whom the notice is to be given.</p>

This amendment is derived from Rule X–1008(a)(1) and is consistent with Rule 2002. The amendment to subdivision (c) is to prevent a timely motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case for substantial abuse from becoming moot merely because a discharge order has been entered. Reference to the Official Form number in subdivision (e) is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>

Also, this subdivision is amended to delay entry of the discharge order if the debtor has not paid in full the filing fee and the administrative fee required to be paid upon the commencement of the case. If the debtor is authorized to pay the fees in installments in accordance with Rule 1006, the discharge order will not be entered until the final installment has been paid.</p>

The time for filing the complaint is not affected by any delay in the commencement or conclusion of the meeting of creditors. This amendment does not affect the right of any party in interest to file a motion for an extension of time to file a complaint objecting to discharge in accordance with Rule 4004(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The substitution of the word “filed” for “made” in subdivision (b) is intended to avoid confusion regarding the time when a motion is “made” for the purpose of applying these rules. <i>See, e.g., In re Coggin</i>, 30 F.3d 1443 (11th Cir. 1994). As amended, this rule requires that a motion for an extension of time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge be <i>filed</i> before the time has expired.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(1)(H) is new. It reflects the 2005 addition to the Code of §§ 727(a)(11) and 1328(g), which require that individual debtors complete a course in personal financial management as a condition to the entry of a discharge. Including this requirement in the rule helps prevent the inadvertent entry of a discharge when the debtor has not complied with this requirement. If a debtor fails to file the required statement regarding a personal financial management course, the clerk will close the bankruptcy case without the entry of a discharge.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(1)(I) is new. It reflects the 2005 addition to the Code of § 727(a)(12). This provision is linked to § 522(q). Section 522(q) limits the availability of the homestead exemption for individuals who have been convicted of a felony or who owe a debt arising from certain causes of action within a particular time frame. The existence of reasonable cause to believe that § 522(q) may be applicable to the debtor constitutes grounds for withholding the discharge.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(1)(J) is new. It accommodates the deadline for filing a reaffirmation agreement established by Rule 4008(a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(1)(K) is new. It reflects the 2005 revisions to § 524 of the Code that alter the requirements for approval of reaffirmation agreements. Section 524(m) sets forth circumstances under which a reaffirmation agreement is presumed to be an undue hardship. This triggers an obligation to review the presumption and may require notice and a hearing. Subdivision (c)(1)(J) has been added to prevent the discharge from being entered until the court approves or disapproves the reaffirmation agreement in accordance with § 524(m).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(1)(L) is new. It implements § 1228(a) of Public Law Number 109–8, an uncodified provision of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which prohibits entry of a discharge unless required tax documents have been provided to the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(3) is new. It postpones the entry of the discharge of an individual debtor in a case under chapter 11, 12, or 13 if there is a question as to the applicability of § 522(q) of the Code. The postponement provides an opportunity for a creditor to file a motion to limit the debtor’s exemption under that provision.</p>

Subdivision (a) is amended to include a deadline for filing a motion objecting to a debtor’s discharge under §§ 727(a)(8), [sic] (a)(9), or 1328(f) of the Code. These sections establish time limits on the issuance of discharges in successive bankruptcy cases by the same debtor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. Subdivision (c)(1) is amended because a corresponding amendment to subdivision (d) directs certain objections to discharge to be brought by motion rather than by complaint. Subparagraph (c)(1)(B) directs the court not to grant a discharge if a motion or complaint objecting to discharge has been filed unless the objection has been decided in the debtor’s favor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(4) is new. It directs the court in chapter 11 and 13 cases to withhold the entry of the discharge if an individual debtor has not filed a statement of completion of a course concerning personal financial management as required by Rule 1007(b)(7).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. Subdivision (d) is amended to direct that objections to discharge under §§ 727(a)(8), (a)(9), and 1328(f) be commenced by motion rather than by complaint. Objections under the specified provisions are contested matters governed by Rule 9014. The title of the subdivision is also amended to reflect this change.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. Subdivision (d) was amended to provide that objections to discharge under §§ 727(a)(8), (a)(9), and 1328(f) are commenced by motion rather than by complaint and are governed by Rule 9014. Because of the relocation of this provision from the previously proposed Rule 7001(b), subdivisions (a) and (c)(1) of this rule were revised to change references to “motion under Rule 7001(b)” to “motion under § 727(a)(8) or (a)(9).” Other stylistic changes were made to the rule, and the Committee Note was revised to reflect these changes.</p>

Subdivision (b) is amended to allow a party, under certain specified circumstances, to seek an extension of time to object to discharge after the time for filing has expired. This amendment addresses the situation in which there is a gap between the expiration of the time for objecting to discharge and the entry of the discharge order. If, during that period, a party discovers facts that would provide grounds for revocation of discharge, it may not be able to seek revocation under § 727(d) of the Code because the facts would have been known prior to the granting of the discharge. Furthermore, during that period the debtor may commit an act that provides a basis for both denial and revocation of the discharge. In those situations, subdivision (b)(2) allows a party to file a motion for an extension of time to object to discharge based on those facts so long as they were not known to the party before expiration of the deadline for objecting. The motion must be filed promptly after discovery of those facts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. Following publication minor stylistic changes were made to the language of the rule, and a sentence was added to the Committee Note to clarify that the rule applies whenever the debtor commits an act during the gap period that provides a basis for both denial and revocation of the discharge.</p>

The introductory language of paragraph (1) is revised to emphasize that the listed circumstances do not just relieve the court of the obligation to enter the discharge promptly but that they prevent the court from entering a discharge.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(1)(H) is amended to reflect the simultaneous amendment of Rule 1007(b)(7). The amendment of the latter rule relieves a debtor of the obligation to file a statement of completion of a course concerning personal financial management if the course provider notifies the court directly that the debtor has completed the course. Subparagraph (H) now requires postponement of the discharge when a debtor fails to file a statement of course completion only if the debtor has an obligation to file the statement.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although a complaint that comes within § 523(c) must ordinarily be filed before determining whether the debtor will be discharged, the court need not determine the issues presented by the complaint filed under this rule until the question of discharge has been determined under Rule 4004.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> differs from subdivision (b) by imposing a deadline for filing complaints to determine the issue of dischargeability of debts set out in § 523(a)(2), (4) or (6) of the Code.

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6fd78f-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2008 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is amended to establish a deadline for filing reaffirmation agreements. The Code sets out a number of prerequisites to the enforceability of reaffirmation agreements. Among those requirements, § 524(k)(6)(A) provides that each reaffirmation agreement must be accompanied by a statement indicating the debtor’s ability to make the payments called for by the agreement. In the event that this statement reflects an insufficient income to allow payment of the reaffirmed debt, § 524(m) provides that a presumption of undue hardship arises, allowing the court to disapprove the reaffirmation agreement, but only after a hearing conducted prior to the entry of discharge. Rule 4004(c)(1)(K) accommodates this provision by delaying the entry of discharge where a presumption of undue hardship arises. However, in order for that rule to be effective, the reaffirmation agreement itself must be filed before the entry of discharge. Under Rule 4004(c)(1) discharge is to be entered promptly after the expiration of the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge, which, under Rule 4004(a), is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under § 341(a). Accordingly, that date is set as the deadline for filing a reaffirmation agreement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Any party may file the agreement with the court. Thus, whichever party has a greater incentive to enforce the agreement usually will file it. In the event that the parties are unable to file a reaffirmation agreement in a timely fashion, the rule grants the court broad discretion to permit a late filing. A corresponding change to Rule 4004(c)(1)(J) accommodates such an extension by providing for a delay in the entry of discharge during the pendency of a motion to extend the time for filing a reaffirmation agreement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 4008 is also amended by deleting provisions regarding the timing of any reaffirmation and discharge hearing. As noted above, § 524(m) itself requires that hearings on undue hardship be conducted prior to the entry of discharge. In other respects, including hearings to approve reaffirmation agreements of unrepresented debtors under § 524(c)(6), the rule leaves discretion to the court to set the hearing at a time appropriate for the particular circumstances presented in the case and consistent with the scheduling needs of the parties.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6fd7a8-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 505(a). The scope of the prohibition on appointment or employment is expanded to include an examiner appointed under § 1104 of the Code and attorneys and other professional persons whose employment must be approved by the court under § 327 or § 1103.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule supplements two statutory provisions. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1910, it is a criminal offense for a judge to appoint a relative as a trustee and, under 28 U.S.C. § 458, a person may not be “appointed to or employed in any office or duty in any court” if he is a relative of any judge of that court. The rule prohibits the appointment or employment of a relative of a bankruptcy judge in a case pending before that bankruptcy judge or before other bankruptcy judges sitting within the district.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A relative is defined in § 101(34) of the Code to be an “individual related by affinity or consanguinity within the third degree as determined by the common law, or individual in a step or adoptive relationship within such third degree.” Persons within the third degree under the common law system are as follows: first degree—parents, brothers and sisters, and children; second degree—grandparents, uncles and aunts, first cousins, nephews and nieces, and grandchildren; third degree—great grandparents, great uncles and aunts, first cousins once removed, second cousins, grand nephews and nieces, great grandchildren. Rule 9001 incorporates the definitions of § 101 of the Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order for the policy of this rule to be meaningfully implemented, it is necessary to extend the prohibition against appointment or employment to the firm or other business association of the ineligible person and to those affiliated with the firm or business association. “Firm” is defined in Rule 9001 to include a professional partnership or corporation of attorneys or accountants. All other types of business and professional associations and relationships are covered by this rule.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6fd7a9-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1985 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amended rule is divided into two subdivisions. Subdivision (a) applies to relatives of bankruptcy judges and subdivision (b) applies to persons who are or have been connected with bankruptcy judges. Subdivision (a) permits no judicial discretion; subdivision (b) allows judicial discretion. In both subdivisions of the amended rule “bankruptcy judge” has been substituted for “judge”. The amended rule makes clear that it only applies to relatives of, or persons connected with, the bankruptcy judge. See <i>In re Hilltop Sand and Gravel, Inc</i>., 35 B.R. 412 (N.D. Ohio 1983).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. The original rule prohibited all bankruptcy judges in a district from appointing or approving the employment of (i) a relative of any bankruptcy judge serving in the district, (ii) the firm or business association of any ineligible relative and (iii) any member or professional employee of the firm or business association of an ineligible relative. In addition, the definition of relative, the third degree relationship under the common law, is quite broad. The restriction on the employment opportunities of relatives of bankruptcy judges was magnified by the fact that many law and accounting firms have practices and offices spanning the nation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Relatives are not eligible for appointment or employment when the bankruptcy judge to whom they are related makes the appointment or approves the employment. Canon 3(b)(4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, which provides that the judge “shall exercise his power of appointment only on the basis of merit, avoiding nepotism and favoritism,” should guide a bankruptcy judge when a relative of a judge of the same bankruptcy court is considered for appointment or employment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>, derived from clause (2) of the original rule, makes a person ineligible for appointment or employment if the person is so connected with a bankruptcy judge making the appointment or approving the employment as to render the appointment or approval of employment improper. The caption and text of the subdivision emphasize that application of the connection test is committed to the sound discretion of the bankruptcy judge who is to make the appointment or approve the employment. All relevant circumstances are to be taken into account by the court. The most important of those circumstances include: the nature and duration of the connection with the bankruptcy judge; whether the connection still exists, and, if not, when it was terminated; and the type of appointment or employment. These and other considerations must be carefully evaluated by the bankruptcy judge.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The policy underlying subdivision (b) is essentially the same as the policy embodied in the Code of Judicial Conduct. Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct instructs a judge to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, and Canon 3(b)(4) provides that the judge “should exercise his power of appointment only on the basis of merit, avoiding nepotism and favoritism.” Subdivision (b) alerts the potential appointee or employee and party seeking approval of employment to consider the possible relevance or impact of subdivision (b) and indicates to them that appropriate disclosure must be made to the bankruptcy court before accepting appointment or employment. The information required may be made a part of the application for approval of employment. See Rule 2014(a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) departs from the former rule in an important respect: a firm or business association is not prohibited from appointment or employment merely because an individual member or employee of the firm or business association is ineligible under subdivision (b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The emphasis given to the bankruptcy court’s judicial discretion in applying subdivision (b) and the absence of a <i>per se</i> extension of ineligibility to the firm or business association or any ineligible individual complement the amendments to subdivision (a). The change is intended to moderate the prior limitation on the employment opportunities of attorneys, accountants and other professional persons who are or who have been connected in some way with the bankruptcy judge. For example, in all but the most unusual situations service as a law clerk to a bankruptcy judge is not the type of connection which alone precludes appointment or employment. Even if a bankruptcy judge determines that it is improper to appoint or approve the employment of a former law clerk in the period immediately after completion of the former law clerk’s service with the judge, the firm which employs the former law clerk will, absent other circumstances, be eligible for employment. In each instance all the facts must be considered by the bankruptcy judge.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) applies to persons connected with a bankruptcy judge. “Person” is defined in § 101 of the Bankruptcy Code to include an “individual, partnership and corporation”. A partnership or corporation may be appointed or employed to serve in a bankruptcy case. If a bankruptcy judge is connected in some way with a partnership or corporation, it is necessary for the court to determine whether the appointment or employment of that partnership or corporation is proper.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amended rule does not regulate professional relationships which do not require approval of a bankruptcy judge. Disqualification of the bankruptcy judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455 may, however, be appropriate. Under Rule 5004(a), a bankruptcy judge may find that disqualification from only some aspect of the case, rather than the entire case, is necessary. A situation may also arise in which the disqualifying circumstance only comes to light after services have been performed. Rule 5004(b) provides that if compensation from the estate is sought for these services, the bankruptcy judge is disqualified from awarding compensation.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6fd7aa-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The 1986 amendments to the Code provide that the United States trustee shall appoint trustees in chapter 7, chapter 12, and chapter 13 cases without the necessity of court approval. This rule is not intended to apply to the appointment of trustees in those cases because it would be inappropriate for a court rule to restrict in advance the exercise of discretion by the executive branch. See Committee Note to Rule 2009.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In chapter 11 cases, a trustee or examiner is appointed by the United States trustee after consultation with parties in interest and subject to court approval. Subdivision (a), as amended, prohibits the approval of the appointment of an individual as a trustee or examiner if the person is a relative of the United States trustee making the appointment or the bankruptcy judge approving the appointment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The United States trustee neither appoints nor approves the employment of professional persons employed pursuant to §§ 327, 1103, or 1114 of the Code. Therefore, subdivision (a) is not a prohibition against judicial approval of employment of a professional person who is a relative of the United States trustee. However, the United States trustee monitors applications for compensation and reimbursement of expenses and may raise, appear and be heard on issues in the case. Employment of relatives of the United States trustee may be approved unless the court finds, after considering the relationship and the particular circumstances of the case, that the relationship would cause the employment to be improper. As used in this rule, “improper” includes the appearance of impropriety.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">United States trustee is defined to include a designee or assistant United States trustee. See Rule 9001. Therefore, subdivision (a) is applicable if the person appointed as trustee or examiner or the professional to be employed is a relative of a designee of the United States trustee or any assistant United States trustee in the region in which the case is pending.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is not exclusive of other laws or rules regulating ethical conduct. See, e.g., 28 CFR § 45.735–5.</p>

By using the address in the register—which must be available to the public—the sender is assured that the mailing address is proper. But the use of an address that differs from the address included in the register does not invalidate the notice if it is otherwise effective under applicable law.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The register may include a separate mailing address for each department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or the state or territory. This rule does not require that addresses of municipalities or other local governmental units be included in the register, but the clerk may include them.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although it is important for the register to be kept current, debtors, their attorneys, and other parties should be able to rely on mailing addresses listed in the register without the need to continuously inquire as to new or amended addresses. Therefore, the clerk must update the register, but only once each year.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To avoid unnecessary cost and burden on the clerk and to keep the register a reasonable length, the clerk is not required to include more than one mailing address for a particular agency, department, or instrumentality of the United States or the state or territory. But if more than one address is included, the clerk is required to include information so that a person using the register could determine when each address should be used. In any event, the inclusion of more than one address for a particular department, agency, or instrumentality does not impose on a person sending a notice the duty to send it to more than one address.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b6fd7d2-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. Disqualification of a bankruptcy judge is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 455. That section provides that the judge “shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned” or under certain other circumstances. In a case under the Code it is possible that the disqualifying circumstance will be isolated to an adversary proceeding or contested matter. The rule makes it clear that when the disqualifying circumstance is limited in that way the judge need only disqualify himself from presiding over that adversary proceeding or contested matter.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is possible, however, that even if the disqualifying circumstance arises in connection with an adversary proceeding, the effect will be so pervasive that disqualification from presiding over the case is appropriate. This distinction is consistent with the definition of “proceeding” in 28 U.S.C. § 455(d)(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> precludes a bankruptcy judge from allowing compensation from the estate to a relative or other person closely associated with the judge. The subdivision applies where the judge has not appointed or approved the employment of the person requesting compensation. Perhaps the most frequent application of the subdivision will be in the allowance of administrative expenses under § 503(b)(3)–(5) of the Code. For example, if an attorney or accountant is retained by an indenture trustee who thereafter makes a substantial contribution in a chapter 11 case, the attorney or accountant may seek compensation under § 503(b)(4). If the attorney or accountant is a relative of or associated with the bankruptcy judge, the judge may not allow compensation to the attorney or accountant. Section 101(34) defines relative and Rule 9001 incorporates the definitions of the Code. See the Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 5002.</p>

The 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act, <ref href="/us/pl/95/598">P.L. 95–598</ref>, included bankruptcy judges in the definition of United States judges in 28 U.S.C. § 451 and they were therefore subject to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 455.

Sections 301–304 of the Code and Rules 1002 and 1003 require that cases under the Code be commenced by filing a petition “with the bankruptcy court.” Other sections of the Code and other rules refer to or contemplate filing but there is no specific reference to filing with the bankruptcy court. For example, § 501 of the Code requires filing of proofs of claim and Rule 3016(c) requires the filing of a disclosure statement. This subdivision applies to all situations in which filing is required. Except when filing in another district is authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 1473, all papers, including complaints commencing adversary proceedings, must be filed in the court where the case under the Code is pending.</p>

Transmittal of papers to the United States trustee may be accomplished by mail or delivery, including delivery by courier, and the technical requirements for service of process are not applicable. Although papers relating to a proceeding commenced in another district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1409 must be filed with the clerk in that district, the papers required to be transmitted to the United States trustee must be mailed or delivered to the United States trustee in the district in which the case under the Code is pending. The United States trustee in the district in which the case is pending monitors the progress of the case and should be informed of all developments in the case wherever the developments take place.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)(2)</i> requires that proof of transmittal to the United States trustee be filed with the clerk. If papers are served on the United States trustee by mail or otherwise, the filing of proof of service would satisfy the requirements of this subdivision. This requirement enables the court to assure that papers are actually transmitted to the United States trustee in compliance with the rules. When the rules require that a paper be transmitted to the United States trustee and proof of transmittal has not been filed with the clerk, the court should not schedule a hearing or should take other appropriate action to assure that the paper is transmitted to the United States trustee. The filing of the verified statement with the clerk also enables other parties in interest to determine whether a paper has been transmitted to the United States trustee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)(3)</i> is designed to relieve the clerk of any obligation under these rules to transmit any paper to the United States trustee if the United States trustee does not wish to receive it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> is amended to include the erroneous delivery of papers intended to be transmitted to the United States trustee.</p>

It is not a suitable role for the office of the clerk to refuse to accept for filing papers not conforming to requirements of form imposed by these rules or by local rules or practices. The enforcement of these rules and local rules is a role for a judge. This amendment does not require the clerk to accept for filing papers sent to the clerk’s office by facsimile transmission.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b7220de-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1996 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is amended to permit, but not require, courts to adopt local rules that allow filing, signing, or verifying of documents by electronic means. However, such local rules must be consistent with technical standards, if any, promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">An important benefit to be derived by permitting filing by electronic means is that the extensive volume of paper received and maintained as records in the clerk’s office will be reduced substantially. With the receipt of electronic data transmissions by computer, the clerk may maintain records electronically without the need to reproduce them in tangible paper form.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Judicial Conference standards governing the technological aspects of electronic filing will result in uniformity among judicial districts to accommodate an increasingly national bar. By delegating to the Judicial Conference the establishment and future amendment of national standards for electronic filing, the Supreme Court and Congress will be relieved of the burden of reviewing and promulgating detailed rules dealing with complex technological standards. Another reason for leaving to the Judicial Conference the formulation of technological standards for electronic filing is that advances in computer technology occur often, and changes in the technological standards may have to be implemented more frequently than would be feasible by rule amendment under the Rules Enabling Act process.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is anticipated that standards established by the Judicial Conference will govern technical specifications for electronic data transmission, such as requirements relating to the formatting of data, speed of transmission, means to transmit copies of supporting documentation, and security of communication procedures. In addition, before procedures for electronic filing are implemented, standards must be established to assure the proper maintenance and integrity of the record and to provide appropriate access and retrieval mechanisms. These matters will be governed by local rules until system-wide standards are adopted by the Judicial Conference.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 9009 requires that the Official Forms shall be observed and used “with alterations as may be appropriate.” Compliance with local rules and any Judicial Conference standards with respect to the formatting or presentation of electronically transmitted data, to the extent that they do not conform to the Official Forms, would be an appropriate alteration within the meaning of Rule 9009.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These rules require that certain documents be in writing. For example, Rule 3001 states that a proof of claim is a “written statement.” Similarly, Rule 3007 provides that an objection to a claim “shall be in writing.” Pursuant to the new subdivision (a)(2), any requirement under these rules that a paper be written may be satisfied by filing the document by electronic means, notwithstanding the fact that the clerk neither receives nor prints a paper reproduction of the electronic data.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 107(a) of the Code provides that a “paper” filed in a case is a public record open to examination by an entity at reasonable times without charge, except as provided in § 107(b). The amendment to subdivision (a)(2) provides that an electronically filed document is to be treated as such a public record.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although under subdivision (a)(2) electronically filed documents may be treated as written papers or as signed or verified writings, it is important to emphasize that such treatment is only for the purpose of applying these rules. In addition, local rules and Judicial Conference standards regarding verification must satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1746.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>GAP Report on Rule 5005</i>. No changes since publication.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b7220df-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2006 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a).</i> Amended Rule 5005(a)(2) acknowledges that many courts have required electronic filing by means of a standing order, procedures manual, or local rule. These local practices reflect the advantages that courts and most litigants realize from electronic filings. Courts requiring electronic filing must make reasonable exceptions for persons for whom electronic filing of documents constitutes an unreasonable denial of access to the courts. Experience with the rule will facilitate convergence on uniform exceptions in an amended Rule 5005(a)(2).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c).</i> The rule is amended to include the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel among the list of persons required to transmit to the proper person erroneously filed or transmitted papers. The amendment is necessary because the bankruptcy appellate panels were not in existence at the time of the original promulgation of the rule. The amendment also inserts the district judge on the list of persons required to transmit papers intended for the United States trustee but erroneously sent to another person. The district judge is included in the list of persons who must transmit papers to the clerk of the bankruptcy court in the first part of the rule, and there is no reason to exclude the district judge from the list of persons who must transmit erroneously filed papers to the United States trustee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication.</i> The published version of the Rule did not include the sentence set out on lines 7–10 above [sic]. The Advisory Committee concluded, based on the written comments received and additional Advisory Committee consideration, that the text of the rule should include a statement regarding the need for courts to protect access to the courts for those whose status might not allow for electronic participation in cases. The published version had relegated this notion to the Committee Note, but further deliberations led to the conclusion that this matter is too important to leave to the Committee Note and instead should be included in the text of the rule.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b7220e0-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Electronic filing has matured. Most districts have adopted local rules that require electronic filing and allow reasonable exceptions as required by the former rule. The time has come to seize the advantages of electronic filing by making it mandatory in all districts, except for filings made by an individual not represented by an attorney. But exceptions continue to be available. Paper filing must be allowed for good cause. And a local rule may allow or require paper filing for other reasons.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Filings by an individual not represented by an attorney are treated separately. It is not yet possible to rely on an assumption that pro se litigants are generally able to seize the advantages of electronic filing. Encounters with the court’s system may prove overwhelming to some. Attempts to work within the system may generate substantial burdens on a pro se party, on other parties, and on the court. Rather than mandate electronic filing, filing by pro se litigants is left for governing by local rules or court order. Efficiently handled electronic filing works to the advantage of all parties and the court. Many courts now allow electronic filing by pro se litigants with the court’s permission. Such approaches may expand with growing experience in these and other courts, along with the growing availability of the systems required for electronic filing and the increasing familiarity of most people with electronic communication. Room is also left for a court to require electronic filing by a pro se litigant by court order or by local rule. Care should be taken to ensure that an order to file electronically does not impede access to the court, and reasonable exceptions must be included in a local rule that requires electronic filing by a pro se litigant.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A filing made through a person’s electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person’s name on a signature block, constitutes the person’s signature. A person’s electronic-filing account means an account established by the court for use of the court’s electronic-filing system, which account the person accesses with the user name and password (or other credentials) issued to that person by the court.</p>

This amendment facilitates the United States trustee’s performance of statutory duties to supervise trustees and administer cases under chapters 7, 12, and 13 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 586. In the absence of a timely objection by the United States trustee or a party in interest, the court may discharge the trustee and close the case pursuant to § 350(a) without the need to review the final report and account or to determine the merits of the trustee’s certification that the estate has been fully administered.</p>

The rule is amended to redesignate the former rule as subdivision (a) and to add new subdivisions (b) and (c) to the rule. Subdivision (b) requires the clerk to provide notice to an individual debtor in a chapter 7 or 13 case that the case may be closed without the entry of a discharge due to the failure of the debtor to file a timely statement of completion of a personal financial management course. The purpose of the notice is to provide the debtor with an opportunity to complete the course and file the appropriate document prior to the filing deadline. Timely filing of the document avoids the need for a motion to extend the time retroactively. It also avoids the potential for closing the case without discharge, and the possible need to pay an additional fee in connection with reopening. Timely filing also benefits the clerk’s office by reducing the number of instances in which cases must be reopened.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. Subdivision (c) requires a foreign representative in a chapter 15 case to file a final report setting out the foreign representative’s actions and results obtained in the United States court. It also requires the foreign representative to give notice of the filing of the report, and provides interested parties with 30 days to object to the report after the foreign representative has certified that notice has been given. In the absence of a timely objection, a presumption arises that the case is fully administered, and the case may be closed.</p>

If a bankruptcy clerk has been appointed for the district, all motions are filed with the bankruptcy clerk. The method for forwarding withdrawal motions to the district court will be established by administrative procedures.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. Section 157(d) permits the district court to order withdrawal on its own motion or the motion of a party. Subdivision (a) of this rule makes it clear that the bankruptcy judge will not conduct hearings on a withdrawal motion. The withdrawal decision is committed exclusively to the district court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. A decision to abstain under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(c) is not appealable. The district court is vested originally with jurisdiction and the decision to relinquish that jurisdiction must ultimately be a matter for the district court. The bankruptcy judge ordinarily will be in the best position to evaluate the grounds asserted for abstention. This subdivision (b) provides that the initial hearing on the motion is before the bankruptcy judge. The procedure for review of the report and recommendation are governed by Rule 9033.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule does not apply to motions under § 305 of the Code for abstention from hearing a case. Judicial decisions will determine the scope of the bankruptcy judge’s authority under § 305.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. Unless the court so orders, proceedings are not stayed when motions are filed for withdrawal or for abstention from hearing a proceeding. Because of the district court’s authority over cases and proceedings, the subdivision authorizes the district court to order a stay or modify a stay ordered by the bankruptcy judge.</p>

This amendment is consistent with § 309(b) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 which amended § 1334(c)(2) so that it allows an appeal to the district court of a bankruptcy court’s order determining an abstention motion. This subdivision is also amended to clarify that the motion is a contested matter governed by Rule 9014 and that it must be served on all parties to the proceeding which is the subject of the motion.</p>

In chapter 15 cases, any party in interest may seek approval of an agreement, frequently referred to as a “protocol,” that will assist with the conduct of the case. Because the needs of the courts and the parties may vary greatly from case to case, the rule does not attempt to limit the form or scope of a protocol. Rather, the rule simply requires that approval of a particular protocol be sought by motion, and designates the persons entitled to notice of the hearing on the motion. These agreements, or protocols, drafted entirely by parties in interest in the case, are intended to provide valuable assistance to the court in the management of the case. Interested parties may find guidelines published by organizations, such as the American Law Institute and the International Insolvency Institute, helpful in crafting agreements or protocols to apply in a particular case.</p>

The definition includes a trustee or receiver appointed in proceedings not under the Code, as well as an assignee for the benefit of creditors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule prescribes the procedure to be followed by a custodian who under § 543 of the Code is required to deliver property to the trustee and to account for its disposition. The examination under subdivision (b) may be initiated (1) on the motion of the custodian required to account under subdivision (a) for an approval of his account and discharge thereon, (2) on the motion of, or the filing of an objection to the custodian’s account by, the trustee or any other party in interest, or (3) on the court’s own initiative. Rule 9014 applies to any contested matter arising under this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 543(d) is similar to an abstention provision. It grants the bankruptcy court discretion to permit the custodian to remain in possession and control of the property. In that event, the custodian is excused from complying with § 543(a)–(c) and thus would not be required to turn over the property to the trustee. When there is no duty to turn over to the trustee, Rule 6002 would not be applicable.</p>

This activity frequently takes place prior to the formation of a creditors’ committee, and it also can include substantial amounts of materials for the court and parties in interest to review and evaluate. This rule is intended to alleviate some of the time pressures present at the start of a case so that full and close consideration can be given to matters that may have a fundamental impact on the case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule provides that the court cannot grant relief on applications for the employment of professional persons, motions for the use, sale, or lease of property of the estate other than such a motion under Rule 4001, and motions to assume or assign executory contracts and unexpired leases for the first 20 days of the case, unless granting relief is necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable harm. This standard is taken from Rule 4001(b)(2) and (c)(2), and decisions under those provisions should provide guidance for the application of this provision.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule does not govern motions and applications made more than 20 days after the filing of the petition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes After Publication</i>. Subdivision (c) was amended by deleting the reference to the rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases. The rule, as revised, now limits only the assumption or assignment of executory contracts or unexpired leases in that subdivision.</p>

The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>

For example, while the rule prohibits, absent immediate and irreparable harm, the court from authorizing the employment of counsel during the first 21 days of a case, it does not prevent the court from providing in an order entered after expiration of the 21-day period that the relief requested in the motion or application is effective as of a date earlier than the issuance of the order. Nor does it prohibit the filing of an application or motion for relief prior to expiration of the 21-day period. Nothing in the rule prevents a professional from representing the trustee or a debtor in possession pending the approval of an application for the approval of the employment under Rule 2014.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendment also clarifies that the scope of the rule is limited to granting the specifically identified relief set out in the subdivisions of the rule. Deleting “regarding” from the rule clarifies that the rule does not prohibit the court from entering orders in the first 21 days of the case that may relate to the motions and applications set out in (a), (b), and (c); it is only prohibited from granting the relief requested by those motions or applications. For example, in the first 21 days of the case, the court could grant the relief requested in a motion to establish bidding procedures for the sale of property of the estate, but it could not, absent immediate and irreparable harm, grant a motion to approve the sale of property.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b74925d-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</i>. Pursuant to § 363(b) of the Code, a trustee or debtor in possession may use, sell, or lease property other than in the ordinary course of business only after notice and hearing. Rule 2002(a), (c) and (i) specifies the time when notice of sale is to be given, the contents of the notice and the persons to whom notice is to be given of sales of property. Subdivision (a) makes those provisions applicable as well to notices for proposed use and lease of property.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Code does not provide the time within which parties may file objections to a proposed sale. Subdivision (b) of the rule requires the objection to be in writing and filed not less than five days before the proposed action is to take place. The objection should also be served within that time on the person who is proposing to take the action which would be either the trustee or debtor in possession. This time period is subject to change by the court. In some instances there is a need to conduct a sale in a short period of time and the court is given discretion to tailor the requirements to the circumstances.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. In some situations a notice of sale for different pieces of property to all persons specified in Rule 2002(a) may be uneconomic and inefficient. This is particularly true in some chapter 7 liquidation cases when there is property of relatively little value which must be sold by the trustee. Subdivision (c) allows a general notice of intent to sell when the aggregate value of the estate’s property is less than $2,500. The gross value is the value of the property without regard to the amount of any debt secured by a lien on the property. It is not necessary to give a detailed notice specifying the time and place of a particular sale. Thus, the requirements of Rule 2002(c) need not be met. If this method of providing notice of sales is used, the subdivision specifies that parties in interest may serve and file objections to the proposed sale of any property within the class and the time for service and filing is fixed at not later than 15 days after mailing the notice. The court may fix a different time. Subdivision (c) would have little utility in chapter 11 cases. Pursuant to Rule 2002(i), the court can limit notices of sale to the creditors’ committee appointed under § 1102 of the Code and the same burdens present in a small chapter 7 case would not exist.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i>. If a timely objection is filed, a hearing is required with respect to the use, sale, or lease of property. Subdivision (d) renders the filing of an objection tantamount to requesting a hearing so as to require a hearing pursuant to §§ 363(b) and 102(l)(B)(i).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i> is derived in part from former Bankruptcy Rule 606(b) but does not carry forward the requirement of that rule that court approval be obtained for sales of property. Pursuant to § 363(b) court approval is not required unless timely objection is made to the proposed sale. The itemized statement or information required by the subdivision is not necessary when it would be impracticable to prepare it or set forth the information. For example, a liquidation sale of retail goods although not in the ordinary course of business may be on a daily ongoing basis and only summaries may be available.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The duty imposed by paragraph (2) does not affect the power of the bankruptcy court to order third persons to execute instruments transferring property purchased at a sale under this subdivision. See, <i>e.g., In re Rosenberg</i>, 138 F.2d 409 (7th Cir. 1943).</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is amended to provide that an objection to a proposed use, sale, or lease of property creates a contested matter governed by Rule 9014. A similar amendment is made to subdivision (d), which was formerly subdivision (c).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> is new. Section 363(f) provides that sales free and clear of liens or other interests are only permitted if one of the five statutory requirements is satisfied. Rule 9013 requires that a motion state with particularity the grounds relied upon by the movant. A motion for approval of a sale free and clear of liens or other interests is subject to Rule 9014, service must be made on the parties holding liens or other interests in the property, and notice of the hearing on the motion and the time for filing objections must be included in the notice given under subdivision (a).</p>

The trustee or debtor in possession may also assign an executory contract, § 365(f)(1), but must first assume the contract, § 365(f)(2). Rule 6006 provides a procedure for obtaining court approval. It does not apply to the automatic rejection of contracts which are not assumed in chapter 7 liquidation cases within 60 days after the order for relief, or to the assumption or rejection of contracts in a plan pursuant to § 1123(b)(2) or § 1322(b)(7).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> by referring to Rule 9014 requires a motion to be brought for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of an executory contract. Normally, the motion will be brought by the trustee, debtor in possession or debtor in a chapter 9 or chapter 13 case. The authorization to assume a contract and to assign it may be sought in a single motion and determined by a single order.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> makes applicable the same motion procedure when the other party to the contract seeks to require the chapter officer to take some action. Section 365(d)(2) recognizes that this procedure is available to these contractual parties. This provision of the Code and subdivision of the rule apply only in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases. A motion is not necessary in chapter 7 cases because in those cases a contract is deemed rejected if the trustee does not timely assume it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> provides for the court to set a hearing on a motion made under subdivision (a) or (b). The other party to the contract should be given appropriate notice of the hearing and the court may order that other parties in interest, such as a creditors’ committee, also be given notice.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 1113, governing collective bargaining agreements, was added to the Code in 1984. It sets out requirements that must be met before a collective bargaining agreement may be rejected. The application to reject a collective bargaining agreement referred to in § 1113 shall be made by motion. The motion to reject creates a contested matter under Rule 9014, and service is made pursuant to Rule 7004 on the representative of the employees. The time periods set forth in § 1113(d) govern the scheduling of the hearing and disposition of a motion to reject the agreement.</p>

In some cases there may be numerous executory contracts and unexpired leases, and this rule permits the combining of up to one hundred of these contracts and leases in a single motion to initiate the contested matter.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule also is amended to authorize the use of a single motion to assume or assign executory contracts and unexpired leases (i) when such contracts and leases are with a single nondebtor party, (ii) when such contracts and leases are being assigned to the same assignee, (iii) when the trustee proposes to assume, but not assign to more than one assignee, real property leases, or (iv) the court authorizes the filing of a joint motion to assume or to assume and assign executory contracts and unexpired leases under other circumstances that are not specifically recognized in the rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">An omnibus motion to assume, assign, or reject multiple executory contracts and unexpired leases must comply with the procedural requirements set forth in subdivision (f) of the rule, unless the court orders otherwise. These requirements are intended to ensure that the nondebtor parties to the contracts and leases receive effective notice of the motion. Among those requirements is the requirement in subdivision (f)(5) that these motions be consecutively numbered (<i>e.g.,</i> Debtor in Possession’s First Omnibus Motion for Authority to Assume Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, Debtor in Possession’s Second Omnibus Motion for Authority to Assume Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, etc.). There may be a need for several of these motions in a particular case. Numbering the motions consecutively is essential to keep track of these motions on the court’s docket and should avoid confusion that might otherwise result from similar or identically-titled motions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (g) of the rule provides that the finality of any order respecting an executory contract or unexpired lease included in an omnibus motion shall be determined as though such contract or lease had been the subject of a separate motion. A party seeking to appeal any such order is neither required, nor permitted, to await the court’s resolution of all other contracts or leases included in the omnibus motion to obtain appellate review of the order. The rule permits the listing of multiple contracts or leases for convenience, and that convenience should not impede timely review of the court’s decision with respect to each contract or lease.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes After Publication</i>. Subdivision (e) of the proposed rule was amended as suggested by the NBC to insert a third category of requests that the trustee may make under an omnibus motion. The list of categories was numbered, and the new category is set out in (e)(2).</p>

Pursuant to § 554, the trustee may abandon property but only after notice and hearing. This section is applicable in chapter 7, 11 and 13 cases. Section 725 requires the trustee to dispose of property in which someone other than the estate has an interest, prior to final distribution. It applies only in chapter 7 cases. Notice and hearing are also required conditions. Section 102(1) provides that “notice and hearing” is construed to mean appropriate notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Neither § 554 nor § 725 specify to whom the notices are to be sent. This rule does not apply to § 554(c). Pursuant to that subsection, property is deemed abandoned if it is not administered. A hearing is not required by the statute.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> requires the notices to be sent to all creditors, indenture trustees, and committees elected under § 705 or appointed under § 1102 of the Code. This may appear burdensome, expensive and inefficient but the subdivision is in keeping with the Code’s requirement for notice and the Code’s intent to remove the bankruptcy judge from undisputed matters. The burden, expense and inefficiency can be alleviated in large measure by incorporating the notice into or together with the notice of the meeting of creditors so that separate notices would not be required.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> implements § 554(b) which specifies that a party in interest may request an order that the trustee abandon property. The rule specifies that the request be by motion and, pursuant to the Code, lists the parties who should receive notice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> requires a hearing when an objection under subdivision (a) is filed or a motion under subdivision (b) is made. Filing of an objection is sufficient to require a hearing; a separate or joined request for a hearing is unnecessary since the objection itself is tantamount to such a request.</p>

It implements § 351(1), which was added to the Code by the 2005 amendments. That provision requires the trustee to notify patients that their patient records will be destroyed if they remain unclaimed for one year after the publication of a notice in an appropriate newspaper. The Code provision also requires that individualized notice be sent to each patient and to the patient’s family member or other contact person.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The variety of health care businesses and the range of current and former patients present the need for flexibility in the creation and publication of the notices that will be given. Nevertheless, there are some matters that must be included in any notice being given to patients, their family members, and contact persons to ensure that sufficient information is provided to these persons regarding the trustee’s intent to dispose of patient records. Subdivision (a) of this rule lists the minimum requirements for notices given under § 351(1)(A), and subdivision (b) governs the form of notices under § 351(1)(B). Notices given under this rule are subject to provisions under applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of patients’ privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104–191 (HIPAA).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) directs the trustee to maintain proof of compliance with § 351(1)(B), but because the proof of compliance may contain patient names that should or must remain confidential, it prohibits filing the proof of compliance unless the court orders the trustee to file it under seal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) requires the trustee to file a report with the court regarding the destruction of patient records. This certification is intended to ensure that the trustee properly completed the destruction process. However, because the report will be filed with the court and ordinarily will be available to the public under § 107, the names, addresses, and other identifying information of patients are not to be included in the report to protect patient privacy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. Subdivision (b)(2) was amended to add the Attorney General of the State where a health care facility is located to the list of entities entitled to notice of the disposal of patient records.</p>

Under Rule 9014 some of the Part VII rules also apply to contested matters.</p>
<p>These Part VII rules are based on the premise that to the extent possible practice before the bankruptcy courts and the district courts should be the same. These rules either incorporate or are adaptations of most of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Although the Part VII rules of the former Bankruptcy Rules also relied heavily on the F.R.Civ.P., the former Part VII rules departed from the civil practice in two significant ways: a trial or pretrial conference had to be scheduled as soon as the adversary proceeding was filed and pleadings had to be filed within periods shorter than those established by the F.R.Civ.P. These departures from the civil practice have been eliminated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The content and numbering of these Part VII rules correlates to the content and numbering of the F.R.Civ.P. Most, but not all, of the F.R.Civ.P. have a comparable Part VII rule. When there is no Part VII rule with a number corresponding to a particular F.R.Civ.P., Parts V and IX of these rules must be consulted to determine if one of the rules in those parts deals with the subject. The list below indicates the F.R.Civ.P., or subdivision thereof, covered by a rule in either Part V or Part IX.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Proceedings to which the rules in Part VII apply directly include those brought to avoid transfers by the debtor under §§ 544, 545, 547, 548 and 549 of the Code; subject to important exceptions, proceedings to recover money or property; proceedings on bonds under Rules 5008(d) and 9025; proceedings under Rule 4004 to determine whether a discharge in a chapter 7 or 11 case should be denied because of an objection grounded on § 727 and proceedings in a chapter 7 or 13 case to revoke a discharge as provided in §§ 727(d) or 1328(e); and proceedings initiated pursuant to § 523(c) of the Code to determine the dischargeability of a particular debt. Those proceedings were classified as adversary proceedings under former Bankruptcy Rule 701.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Also included as adversary proceedings are proceedings to revoke an order of confirmation of a plan in a chapter 11 or 13 case as provided in §§ 1144 and 1330, to subordinate under § 510(c), other than as part of a plan, an allowed claim or interest, and to sell under § 363(h) both the interest of the estate and a co-owner in property.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Declaratory judgments with respect to the subject matter of the various adversary proceedings are also adversary proceedings.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Any claim or cause of action removed to a bankruptcy court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1478 is also an adversary proceeding.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Unlike former Bankruptcy Rule 701, requests for relief from an automatic stay do not commence an adversary proceeding. Section 362(e) of the Code and Rule 4001 establish an expedited schedule for judicial disposition of requests for relief from the automatic stay. The formalities of the adversary proceeding process and the time for serving pleadings are not well suited to the expedited schedule. The motion practice prescribed in Rule 4001 is best suited to such requests because the court has the flexibility to fix hearing dates and other deadlines appropriate to the particular situation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Clause (1) contains important exceptions. A person with an interest in property in the possession of the trustee or debtor in possession may seek to recover or reclaim that property under § 554(b) or § 725 of the Code. Since many attempts to recover or reclaim property under these two sections do not generate disputes, application of the formalities of the Part VII Rules is not appropriate. Also excluded from adversary proceedings is litigation arising from an examination under Rule 2017 of a debtor’s payments of money or transfers of property to an attorney representing the debtor in a case under the Code or an examination of a superseded administration under Rule 6002.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Exemptions and objections thereto are governed by Rule 4003. Filing of proofs of claim and the allowances thereof are governed by Rules 3001–3005, and objections to claims are governed by Rule 3007. When an objection to a claim is joined with a demand for relief of the kind specified in this Rule 7001, the matter becomes an adversary proceeding. See Rule 3007.</p>

Because objections to discharge on these grounds typically present issues more easily resolved than other objections to discharge, the more formal procedures applicable to adversary proceedings, such as commencement by a complaint, are not required. Instead, objections on these three grounds are governed by Rule 4004(d). In an appropriate case, however, Rule 9014(c) allows the court to order that additional provisions of Part VII of the rules apply to these matters.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. The proposed addition of subsection (b) was deleted, and the content of that provision was moved to Rule 4004(d). The exception in paragraph (4) of the rule was revised to refer to objections to discharge under §§ 727(a)(8), (a)(9), and 1328(f) of the Code. The redesignation of the existing rule as subdivision (a) was also deleted. The Committee Note was revised to reflect these changes.</p>

The determination of the amount of a secured claim may be sought by motion or through a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan in accordance with Rule 3012. An adversary proceeding continues to be required for lien avoidance not governed by Rule 4003(d).</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Additionally, the following substantive changes have been made.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (a) is amended to create an exception for certain turnover proceedings under § 542(a) of the Code. An individual debtor may need to obtain the prompt return from a third party of tangible personal property—such as an automobile or tools of the trade—in order to produce income to fund a plan or to regain the use of property that may be exempted. As noted by Justice Sotomayor in her concurrence in <i>City of Chicago v. Fulton</i>, 141 S. Ct. 585, 592–95 (2021), the more formal procedures applicable to adversary proceedings can be too time-consuming in such a situation. Instead, the debtor can now proceed by motion to require turnover of such property under § 542(a), and the procedures of Rule 9014 will apply. In an appropriate case, however, Rule 9014(c) allows the court to order that additional provisions of Part VII of the rules will apply to the matter.</p>

Each of those rules contains a cross reference to another Federal Rule; however, the Part VII rule which incorporates the cross-referenced Federal Rule modifies the Federal Rule in some way. Under this Rule 7002 the cross reference is to the Federal Rule as modified by Part VII. For example, Rule 5 F.R.Civ.P., which is made applicable to adversary proceedings by Rule 7005, contains a reference to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. Under this Rule 7002, the cross reference is to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. as modified by Rule 7004.</p>

Each of those Federal Rules contains a cross reference to another Federal Rule which is not modified by the Part VII or Part IX rule which makes the cross-referenced Federal Rule applicable. Since the cross-referenced rule is not modified by a Part VII rule this Rule 7002 does not apply.</p>

This rule is amended to avoid the necessity of mailing copies of a summons and complaint or other pleadings to the Attorney General and to the United States attorney when service on the United States trustee is required only because the United States trustee is acting as a case trustee. For example, a proceeding commenced by a creditor to dismiss a case for unreasonable delay under § 707(a) is governed by Rule 9014 which requires service on the trustee pursuant to the requirements of Rule 7004 for the service of a summons and complaint. The Attorney General and the United States attorney would have no interest in receiving a copy of the motion to dismiss. Mailing to the office of the United States trustee when acting as the case trustee is sufficient in such cases.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i> is added in anticipation of substantial amendment to, and restructuring of subdivisions of, Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(e) <inline class="small-caps">Summons: Service Upon Party Not Inhabitant of or Found Within State</inline>. Whenever a statute of the United States or an order of court thereunder provides for service of a summons, or of a notice, or of an order in lieu of summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state in which the district court is held, service may be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by the statute or order, or, if there is no provision therein prescribing the manner of service, in a manner stated in this rule. Whenever a statute or rule of court of the state in which the district court is held provides (1) for service of a summons, or of a notice, or of an order in lieu of summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state, or (2) for service upon or notice to such a party to appear and respond or defend in an action by reason of the attachment or garnishment or similar seizure of the party’s property located within the state, service may in either case be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the statute or rule.</p>

If service is made under subdivision (c)(2)(C)(ii) of this rule, return shall be made by the sender’s filing with the court the acknowledgment received pursuant to such subdivision.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(h) <inline class="small-caps">Amendment</inline>. At any time in its discretion and upon such terms as it deems just, the court may allow any process or proof of service thereof to be amended, unless it clearly appears that material prejudice would result to the substantial rights of the party against whom the process issued.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(1) <i>Manner</i>. When the federal or state law referred to in subdivision (e) of this rule authorizes service upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state in which the district court is held, and service is to be effected upon the party in a foreign country, it is also sufficient if service of the summons and complaint is made: (A) in the manner prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service in that country in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction; or (B) as directed by the foreign authority in response to a letter rogatory, when service in either case is reasonably calculated to give actual notice; or (C) upon an individual, by delivery to the individual personally, and upon a corporation or partnership or association, by delivery to an officer, a managing or general agent; or (D) by any form of mail, requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the party to be served; or (E) as directed by order of the court. Service under (C) or (E) above may be made by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age or who is designated by order of the district court or by the foreign court. On request, the clerk shall deliver the summons to the plaintiff for transmission to the person or the foreign court or officer who will make the service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(2) <i>Return</i>. Proof of service may be made as prescribed by subdivision (g) of this rule, or by the law of the foreign country, or by order of the court. When service is made pursuant to subparagraph (1)(D) of this subdivision, proof of service shall include a receipt signed by the addressee or other evidence of delivery to the addressee satisfactory to the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(j) <inline class="small-caps">Summons: Time Limit for Service</inline>. If a service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint and the party on whose behalf such service was required cannot show good cause why such service was not made within that period, the action shall be dismissed as to that defendant without prejudice upon the court’s own initiative with notice to such party or upon motion. This subdivision shall not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (i) of this rule.</p>

Rule 7004, as amended, continues to provide for service by first class mail as an alternative to the methods of personal service provided in Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P., except as provided in the new subdivision (h).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 4(d)(2) F.R.Civ.P. provides a procedure by which the plaintiff may request by first class mail that the defendant waive service of the summons. This procedure is not applicable in adversary proceedings because it is not necessary in view of the availability of service by mail pursuant to Rule 7004(b). However, if a written waiver of service of a summons is made in an adversary proceeding, Rule 4(d)(1) F.R.Civ.P. applies so that the defendant does not thereby waive any objection to the venue or the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (b)(4) and (b)(5)</i> are amended to conform to the 1993 amendments to Rule 4(i)(3) F.R.Civ.P., which protect the plaintiff from the hazard of losing a substantive right because of failure to comply with the requirements of multiple service when the United States or an officer, agency, or corporation of the United States is a defendant. These subdivisions also are amended to require that the summons and complaint be addressed to the civil process clerk at the office of the United States attorney.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>, which has governed service in a foreign country, is abrogated and Rule 4(f) and (h)(2) F.R.Civ.P., as substantially revised in 1993, are made applicable in adversary proceedings.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new subdivision (f) is consistent with the 1993 amendments to F.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2). It clarifies that service or filing a waiver of service in accordance with this rule or the applicable subdivisions of F.R.Civ.P. 4 is sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendant. See the committee note to the 1993 amendments to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i> is abrogated. This subdivision was promulgated in 1991 so that anticipated revisions to Rule 4 F.R.Civ.P. would not affect service of process in adversary proceedings until further amendment to Rule 7004.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (h)</i> and the first phrase of subdivision (b) were added by § 114 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103–394, <ref href="/us/stat/108/4106">108 Stat. 4106</ref>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>GAP Report on Rule 7004</i>. After publication of the proposed amendments, Rule 7004(b) was amended and Rule 7004(h) was added by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 to provide for service by certified mail on an insured depository institution. The above draft includes those statutory amendments (without underlining new language or striking former language). No other changes have been made since publication, except for stylistic changes.</p>

In some bankruptcy cases the trustee or debtor in possession may commence hundreds of adversary proceedings simultaneously, and permitting the electronic signing and sealing of the summonses for those proceedings increases the efficiency of the clerk’s office without any negative impact on any party. The rule only authorizes electronic issuance of the summons. It does not address the service requirements for the summons. Those requirements are set out elsewhere in Rule 7004, and nothing in Rule 7004(a)(2) should be construed as authorizing electronic service of a summons.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. No changes were made after publication.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b794d08-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2006 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under current Rule 7004, an entity may serve a summons and complaint upon the debtor by personal service or by mail. If the entity chooses to serve the debtor by mail, it must also serve a copy of the summons and complaint on the debtor’s attorney by mail. If the entity effects personal service on the debtor, there is no requirement that the debtor’s attorney also be served.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)(9).</i> The rule is amended to delete the reference in subdivision (b)(9) to the debtor’s address as set forth in the statement of financial affairs. In 1991, the Official Form of the statement of financial affairs was revised and no longer includes a question regarding the debtor’s current residence. Since that time, Official Form 1, the petition, has required the debtor to list both the debtor’s residence and mailing address. Therefore, the subdivision is amended to delete the statement of financial affairs as a document that might contain an address at which the debtor can be served.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g).</i> The rule is amended to require service on the debtor’s attorney whenever the debtor is served with a summons and complaint. The amendment makes this change by deleting that portion of Rule 7004(b)(9) that requires service on the debtor’s attorney when the debtor is served by mail, and relocates the obligation to serve the debtor’s attorney into new subdivision (g). Service on the debtor’s attorney is not limited to mail service, but may be accomplished by any means permitted under Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication.</i> The Committee Note was amended to add the final [second] paragraph of the Note. The new paragraph describes the reason for the deletion of the reference in the rule to the statement of affairs as a source for the debtor’s address. This was a secondary reason for amending the rule, and even in the absence of public comment on the proposed amendment, the Advisory Committee believes that the additional explanation in the Committee Note is appropriate.</p>

The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>

The amendment reduces that period from fourteen days to seven days after issuance of the summons. Because Rule 7012 provides that the defendant’s time to answer the complaint is calculated from the date the summons is issued, a lengthy delay between issuance and service of the summons may unduly shorten the defendant’s time to respond. The amendment is therefore intended to encourage prompt service after issuance of a summons. If service of the summons within any seven-day period is impracticable, a court retains the discretion to enlarge that period of time under Rule 9006(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. A new sentence referring to the availability of an enlargement of time under Rule 9006(b) was added to the Committee Note. The only other change made after publication and comment was stylistic.</p>

In 2007, Civil Rule 4 was amended, and the language of old Civil Rule 4(d)(1) was modified and renumbered as Civil Rule 4(d)(5).

A bankruptcy judge may enter a final order or judgment in a core proceeding. In a non-core proceeding, absent consent of the parties, the bankruptcy judge may not enter a final order or judgment but may only submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district judge who will enter the final order or judgment. 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1). The amendment to subdivision (a) of this rule requires an allegation as to whether a proceeding is core or non-core. A party who alleges that the proceeding is non-core shall state whether the party does or does not consent to the entry of a final order or judgment by the bankruptcy judge. Failure to include the statement of consent does not constitute consent. Only express consent in the pleadings or otherwise is effective to authorize entry of a final order or judgment by the bankruptcy judge in a non-core proceeding. Amendments to Rule 7012 require that the defendant admit or deny the allegation as to whether the proceeding is core or non-core.</p>

That requirement, which differed from the practice under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, had the potential to serve as a trap for the unwary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The procedures for seeking an award of attorney’s fees are now set out in Rule 7054(b)(2), which makes applicable most of the provisions of Rule 54(d)(2) F.R.Civ.P. As specified by Rule 54(d)(2)(A) and (B) F.R.Civ.P., a claim for attorney’s fees must be made by a motion filed no later than 14 days after entry of the judgment unless the governing substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages. When fees are an element of damages, such as when the terms of a contract provide for the recovery of fees incurred prior to the instant adversary proceeding, the general pleading requirements of this rule still apply.</p>

Rule 7012(b) has been amended to require a similar statement in a responsive pleading. The bankruptcy judge will then determine the appropriate course of proceedings under Rule 7016.</p>

In 2009, Rule 52 F. R. Civ. P. was amended to extend the deadline for filing those post judgment motions to no later than 28 days after entry of the judgment. That deadline corresponds to the 30-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule 4(a)(1)(A) F. R. App. P. In a bankruptcy case, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day deadline for filing a motion for amended or additional findings would effectively override the notice of appeal deadline under Rule 8002(a) but for this amendment.</p>

Subdivision (b) is amended to provide more time for a party to respond to the prevailing party’s bill of costs. The former rule’s provision of one day’s notice was unrealistically short. The change to 14 days conforms to the change made to Civil Rule 54(d). Extension from five to seven days of the time for serving a motion for court review of the clerk’s action implements changes in connection with the <date date="2009-12-01">December 1, 2009</date>, amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. Throughout the rules, deadlines have been amended in the following manner:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 5-day periods became 7-day periods.</p>

It does so by adding new paragraph (2) that incorporates most of the provisions of Rule 54(d)(2) F.R.Civ.P. The title of subdivision (b) is amended to reflect the new content, and the previously existing provision governing costs is renumbered as paragraph (1) and re-titled.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As provided in Rule 54(d)(2)(A), new subsection (b)(2) does not apply to fees recoverable as an element of damages, as when sought under the terms of a contract providing for the recovery of fees incurred prior to the instant adversary proceeding. Such fees typically are required to be claimed in a pleading.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 54(d)(2)(D) F.R.Civ.P. does not apply in adversary proceedings insofar as it authorizes the referral of fee matters to a master or a magistrate judge. The use of masters is not authorized in bankruptcy cases, <i>see</i> Rule 9031, and 28 U.S.C. § 636 does not authorize a magistrate judge to exercise jurisdiction upon referral by a bankruptcy judge. The remaining provision of Rule 54(d)(2)(D) is expressed in subdivision (b)(2)(B) of this rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 54(d)(2)(C) refers to Rule 78 F.R.Civ.P., which is not applicable in adversary proceedings. Accordingly, that reference is not incorporated by this rule.</p>

The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure generally govern bankruptcy appeals to courts of appeals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Eight of the Part VIII rules do, however, relate to appeals to courts of appeals. Rule 8004(e) provides that the authorization by a court of appeals of a direct appeal of a bankruptcy court’s interlocutory order or decree constitutes a grant of leave to appeal. Rule 8006 governs the procedure for certification under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2) of a direct appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a court of appeals. Rule 8007 addresses stays pending a direct appeal to a court of appeals. Rule 8008 authorizes a bankruptcy court to issue an indicative ruling while an appeal is pending in a court of appeals. Rules 8009 and 8010 govern the record on appeal in a direct appeal to a court of appeals. Rule 8025 governs the granting of a stay of a district court or BAP judgment pending an appeal to the court of appeals. And Rule 8028 authorizes the court of appeals to suspend applicable Part VIII rules in a particular case, subject to certain enumerated exceptions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These rules take account of the evolving technology in the federal courts for the electronic filing, storage, and transmission of documents. Except as applied to pro se parties, the Part VIII rules require documents to be sent electronically, unless applicable court rules or orders expressly require or permit another means of sending a particular document.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b7e0782-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rule 8002 and F.R.App.P. 4(a) and (c). With the exception of subdivision (c), the changes to the former rule are stylistic. The rule retains the former rule’s 14-day time period for filing a notice of appeal, as opposed to the longer periods permitted for appeals in civil cases under F.R.App.P. 4(a). </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) continues to allow any other party to file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the first notice of appeal is filed, or thereafter to the extent otherwise authorized by this rule. Subdivision (a) also retains provisions of the former rule that prescribe the date the notice of appeal is deemed filed if the appellant files it prematurely or in the wrong court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b), like former Rule 8002(b) and F.R.App.P. 4(a), tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal when certain postjudgment motions are filed, and it prescribes the effective date of a notice of appeal that is filed before the court disposes of all of the specified motions. As under the former rule, a party that wants to appeal the court’s disposition of the motion or the alteration or amendment of a judgment, order, or decree in response to such a motion must file a notice of appeal or, if it has already filed one, an amended notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although Rule 8003(a)(3)(C) requires a notice of appeal to be accompanied by the required fee, no additional fee is required for the filing of an amended notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) mirrors the provisions of F.R.App.P. 4(c)(1) and (2), which specify timing rules for a notice of appeal filed by an inmate confined in an institution.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) continues to allow the court to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal, except with respect to certain specified judgments, orders, and decrees.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. Stylistic changes were made to the title of subdivision (b)(3) and to subdivision (c)(1).</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b7e0783-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Clarifying amendments are made to subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of the rule. They are modeled on parallel provisions of F.R.App.P. 4.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (5) is added to subdivision (a) to clarify the effect of the separate-document requirement of F.R.Civ.P. 58(a) on the entry of a judgment, order, or decree for the purpose of determining the time for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 7058 adopts F.R.Civ.P. 58 for adversary proceedings. If Rule 58(a) requires a judgment to be set out in a separate document, the time for filing a notice of appeal runs—subject to subdivisions (b) and (c)—from when the judgment is docketed and the judgment is set out in a separate document or, if no separate document is prepared, from 150 days from when the judgment is entered in the docket. The court’s failure to comply with the separate-document requirement of Rule 58(a), however, does not affect the validity of an appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 58 does not apply in contested matters. Instead, under Rule 9021, a separate document is not required, and a judgment or order is effective when it is entered in the docket. The time for filing a notice of appeal under subdivision (a) therefore begins to run upon docket entry in contested matters, as well as in adversary proceedings for which Rule 58 does not require a separate document.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A clarifying amendment is made to subdivision (b)(1) to conform to a recent amendment to F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)—from which Rule 8002(b)(1) is derived. Former Rule 8002(b)(1) provided that “[i]f a party timely files in the bankruptcy court” certain post-judgment motions, “the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.” Responding to a circuit split concerning the meaning of “timely” in F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4), the amendment adopts the majority approach and rejects the approach taken in <i>National Ecological Foundation v. Alexander</i>, 496 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 2007). A motion made after the time allowed by the Bankruptcy Rules will not qualify as a motion that, under Rule 8002(b)(1), re-starts the appeal time—and that fact is not altered by, for example, a court order that sets a due date that is later than permitted by the Bankruptcy Rules, another party’s consent or failure to object to the motion’s lateness, or the court’s disposition of the motion without explicit reliance on untimeliness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(1) is revised to conform to F.R.App.P. 4(c)(1), which was recently amended to streamline and clarify the operation of the inmate-filing rule. The rule requires the inmate to show timely deposit and prepayment of postage. It is amended to specify that a notice is timely if it is accompanied by a declaration or notarized statement stating the date the notice was deposited in the institution’s mail system and attesting to the prepayment of first-class postage. The declaration must state that first-class postage “is being prepaid,”; not (as directed by the former rule) that first-class postage “has been prepaid.” This change reflects the fact that inmates may need to rely upon the institution to affix postage after the inmate has deposited the document in the institution’s mail system. A new Director’s Form sets out a suggested form of the declaration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amended rule also provides that a notice is timely without a declaration or notarized statement if other evidence accompanying the notice shows that the notice was deposited on or before the due date and that postage was prepaid. If the notice is not accompanied by evidence that establishes timely deposit and prepayment of postage, then the appellate court—district court, BAP, or court of appeals in the case of a direct appeal—has discretion to accept a declaration or notarized statement at a later date. The rule uses the phrase “exercises its discretion to permit”—rather than simply “permits”—to help ensure that pro se inmates are aware that a court will not necessarily forgive a failure to provide the declaration initially.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b7e07a4-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from several former Bankruptcy Rule and Appellate Rule provisions. It addresses appeals as of right, joint and consolidated appeals, service of the notice of appeal, and the timing of the docketing of an appeal in the district court or BAP.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) incorporates, with stylistic changes, much of the content of former Rule 8001(a) regarding the taking of an appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1) or (2). The rule now requires that the judgment, order, or decree being appealed be attached to the notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b), which is an adaptation of F.R.App.P. 3(b), permits the filing of a joint notice of appeal by multiple appellants that have sufficiently similar interests that their joinder is practicable. It also allows the district court or BAP to consolidate appeals taken separately by two or more parties.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is derived from former Rule 8004 and F.R.App.P. 3(d). Under Rule 8001(c), the former rule’s requirement that service of the notice of appeal be accomplished by mailing is generally modified to require that the bankruptcy clerk serve counsel by electronic means. Service on pro se parties must be made by sending the notice to the address most recently provided to the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) modifies the provision of former Rule 8007(b), which delayed the docketing of an appeal by the district court or BAP until the record was complete and the bankruptcy clerk transmitted it. The new provision, adapted from F.R.App.P. 3(d) and 12(a), requires the bankruptcy clerk to promptly transmit the notice of appeal to the clerk of the district court or BAP. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal. Under this procedure, motions filed in the district court or BAP prior to completion and transmission of the record can generally be placed on the docket of an already pending appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. In subdivision (d)(2), the direction for docketing a bankruptcy appeal was changed to reflect the fact that many bankruptcy appeals have dual titles—the bankruptcy case itself and the adversary proceeding that is the subject of the appeal. Stylistic changes were made to subdivision (c)(1). Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b7e07a5-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2023 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) is amended to conform to recent amendments to Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), which clarified that the designation of a particular interlocutory order in a notice of appeal does not prevent the appellate court from reviewing all orders that merged into the judgment or appealable order or decree. These amendments reflect that a notice of appeal is supposed to be a simple document that provides notice that a party is appealing and invokes the jurisdiction of the appellate court. It therefore must state who is appealing, what is being appealed, and to what court the appeal is being taken. It is the role of the briefs, not the notice of appeal, to focus the issues on appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(3)(B) is amended in an effort to avoid the misconception that it is necessary or appropriate to identify each and every order of the bankruptcy court that the appellant may wish to challenge on appeal. It requires the attachment of “the judgment—or the appealable order or decree—from which the appeal is taken”—and the phrase “or the part of it” is deleted. In most cases, because of the merger principle, it is appropriate to identify and attach only the judgment or the appealable order or decree from which the appeal as of right is taken.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(4) now calls attention to the merger principle. The general merger rule can be stated simply: an appeal from a final judgment or appealable order or decree permits review of all rulings that led up to the judgment, order, or decree. Because this general rule is subject to some exceptions and complications, the amendment does not attempt to codify the merger principle but instead leaves its details to case law. The amendment does not change the principle established in <i>Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co.</i>, 486 U.S. 196, 202–03 (1988), that “a decision on the merits is a ‘final decision’ . . . whether or not there remains for adjudication a request for attorney’s fees attributable to the case.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Sometimes a party who is aggrieved by a final judgment will make a motion in the bankruptcy court instead of immediately filing a notice of appeal. Rule 8002(b)(1) permits a party who makes certain motions to await disposition of those motions before appealing. But some courts treat a notice of appeal that identifies only the order disposing of such a motion as limited to that order, rather than bringing the final judgment before the appellate court for review. To reduce the unintended loss of appellate rights in this situation, subdivision (a)(5) is added. This amendment does not alter the requirement of Rule 8002(b)(3) (requiring a notice of appeal or an amended notice of appeal if a party intends to challenge an order disposing of certain motions).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(6) is added to enable deliberate limitations of the notice of appeal. It allows an appellant to identify only part of a judgment or appealable order or decree by expressly stating that the notice of appeal is so limited. Without such an express statement, however, specific identifications do not limit the scope of the notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On occasion, a party may file a notice of appeal after a judgment or appealable order or decree but identify only a previously nonappealable order that merged into that judgment or appealable order or decree. To deal with this situation, subdivision (a)(7) is added to provide that an appeal must not be dismissed for failure to properly identify the judgment or appealable order or decree if the notice of appeal was filed after entry of the judgment or appealable order or decree and identifies an order that merged into the judgment, order, or decree from which the appeal is taken. In this situation, a court should act as if the notice had properly identified the judgment or appealable order or decree. In determining whether a notice of appeal was filed after the entry of judgment, Rules 8002(a)(2) and (b)(2) apply.</p>

It retains the practice for interlocutory bankruptcy appeals of requiring a notice of appeal to be filed along with a motion for leave to appeal. Like current Rule 8003, it alters the timing of the docketing of the appeal in the district court or BAP.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) requires a party seeking leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3) to file with the bankruptcy clerk both a notice of appeal and a motion for leave to appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) prescribes the contents of the motion, retaining the requirements of former Rule 8003(a). It also continues to allow another party to file a cross-motion or response to the appellant’s motion. Because of the prompt docketing of the appeal under the current rule, the cross-motion or response must be filed in the district court or BAP, rather than in the bankruptcy court as the former rule required.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit promptly to the district court or BAP the notice of appeal and the motion for leave to appeal. Upon receipt of the notice and the motion, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise, no oral argument will be held on the motion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) retains the provisions of former Rule 8003(c). It provides that if the appellant timely files a notice of appeal, but fails to file a motion for leave to appeal, the court can either direct that a motion be filed or treat the notice of appeal as the motion and either grant or deny leave.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e), like former Rule 8003(d), treats the authorization of a direct appeal by the court of appeals as a grant of leave to appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3) if the district court or BAP has not already granted leave. Thus, a separate order granting leave to appeal is not required. If the court of appeals grants permission to appeal, the record must be assembled and transmitted in accordance with Rules 8009 and 8010.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. In subdivision (c)(2), the direction for docketing a bankruptcy appeal was changed to reflect the fact that many bankruptcy appeals have dual titles—the bankruptcy case itself and the adversary proceeding that is the subject of the appeal. As published, subdivision (c)(3) stated that the court must dismiss the appeal if the motion for leave to appeal is denied. That sentence was deleted.</p>

It applies only in districts in which an appeal to a BAP is authorized.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As the former rule required, subdivision (a) provides that an appellant that elects to have a district court, rather than a BAP, hear its appeal must file with the bankruptcy clerk a statement of election when it files its notice of appeal. The statement must conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form. For appellants, that statement is included in the Notice of Appeal Official Form. If a BAP has been established for appeals from the bankruptcy court and the appellant does not file a timely statement of election, any other party that elects to have the district court hear the appeal must file a statement of election with the BAP clerk no later than 30 days after service of the notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit all appeal documents to the district clerk if the appellant files a timely statement of election. If the appellant does not make that election, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit those documents to the BAP clerk. Upon a timely election by any other party, the BAP clerk must promptly transmit the appeal documents to the district clerk and notify the bankruptcy clerk that the appeal has been transferred.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) provides a new procedure for the resolution of disputes regarding the validity of an election. A motion seeking the determination of the validity of an election must be filed no later than 14 days after the statement of election is filed. Nothing in this rule prevents a court from determining the validity of an election on its own motion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) provides that, in the case of an appeal by leave, if the appellant files a motion for leave to appeal but fails to file a notice of appeal, the filing and service of the motion will be treated for timing purposes under this rule as the filing and service of the notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. In subdivision (b), a requirement was added that the BAP clerk notify the bankruptcy clerk if an appeal is transferred from the BAP to the district court upon the election of an appellee. Conforming and clarifying changes were made to the Committee Note.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b7e07eb-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rule 8001(f), and it provides the procedures for the certification of a direct appeal of a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to the court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2). Once a case has been certified in the bankruptcy court, the district court, or the BAP for direct appeal and a request for permission to appeal has been timely filed with the circuit clerk, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure govern further proceedings in the court of appeals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a), like the former rule, requires that an appeal be properly taken—now under Rule 8003 or 8004—before a certification for direct review in the court of appeals takes effect. This rule requires the timely filing of a notice of appeal under Rule 8002 and accounts for the delayed effectiveness of a notice of appeal under the circumstances specified in that rule. Ordinarily, a notice of appeal is effective when it is filed in the bankruptcy court. Rule 8002, however, delays the effectiveness of a notice of appeal when (1) it is filed after the announcement of a decision or order but prior to the entry of the judgment, order, or decree; or (2) it is filed after the announcement or entry of a judgment, order, or decree but before the bankruptcy court disposes of certain postjudgment motions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the bankruptcy court enters an interlocutory order or decree that is appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3), certification for direct review in the court of appeals may take effect before the district court or BAP grants leave to appeal. The certification is effective when the actions specified in subdivision (a) have occurred. Rule 8004(e) provides that if the court of appeals grants permission to take a direct appeal before leave to appeal an interlocutory ruling has been granted, the authorization by the court of appeals is treated as the granting of leave to appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) provides that a certification must be filed in the court where the matter is pending, as determined by this subdivision. This provision modifies the former rule. Because of the prompt docketing of appeals in the district court or BAP under Rules 8003 and 8004, a matter is deemed—for purposes of this rule only—to remain pending in the bankruptcy court for 30 days after the effective date of the notice of appeal. This provision will in appropriate cases give the bankruptcy judge, who will be familiar with the matter being appealed, an opportunity to decide whether certification for direct review is appropriate. Similarly, subdivision (d) provides that only the court where the matter is then pending according to subdivision (b) may make a certification on its own motion or on the request of one or more parties.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 158(d)(2) provides three different ways in which an appeal may be certified for direct review. Implementing these options, the rule provides in subdivision (c) for the joint certification by all appellants and appellees; in subdivision (e) for the bankruptcy court’s, district court’s, or BAP’s certification on its own motion; and in subdivision (f) for the bankruptcy court’s, district court’s, or BAP’s certification on request of a party or a majority of appellants and a majority of appellees. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (g) requires that, once a certification for direct review is made, a request to the court of appeals for permission to take a direct appeal to that court must be filed with the clerk of the court of appeals no later than 30 days after the effective date of the certification. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 6(c), which incorporates all of F.R.App.P. 5 except subdivision (a)(3), prescribes the procedure for requesting the permission of the court of appeals and governs proceedings that take place thereafter in that court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. In subdivisions (b) and (g), cross-references were added. In subdivision (f)(4), the statement regarding the inapplicability of Rule 9014 was deleted as unnecessary. A clarifying change was made to the first paragraph of the Committee Note.</p>

It is a counterpart to subdivision (e)(2), which allows a party to file a similar statement when the court certifies direct review on the court’s own motion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The bankruptcy court may file a supplemental statement within 14 days after the certification, even if the appeal is no longer pending before it according to subdivision (b). If the appeal is pending in the district court or BAP during that 14-day period, the appellate court is authorized to file a statement. In all cases, the filing of a statement by the court is discretionary.</p>

It now applies to direct appeals in courts of appeals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a), like the former rule, requires a party ordinarily to seek relief pending an appeal in the bankruptcy court. Subdivision (a)(1) expands the list of relief enumerated in F.R.App.P. 8(a)(1) to reflect bankruptcy practice. It includes the suspension or continuation of other proceedings in the bankruptcy case, as authorized by subdivision (e). Subdivision (a)(2) clarifies that a motion for a stay pending appeal, approval of a supersedeas bond, or any other relief specified in paragraph (1) may be made in the bankruptcy court before or after the filing of a notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) authorizes a party to seek the relief specified in (a)(1), or the vacation or modification of the granting of such relief, by means of a motion filed in the court where the appeal is pending—district court, BAP, or the court of appeals on direct appeal. Accordingly, a notice of appeal need not be filed with respect to a bankruptcy court’s order granting or denying such a motion. The motion for relief in the district court, BAP, or court of appeals must state why it was impracticable to seek relief initially in the bankruptcy court, if a motion was not filed there, or why the bankruptcy court denied the relief sought.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivisions (c) and (d) retain the provisions of the former rule that permit the district court or BAP—and now the court of appeals—to condition the granting of relief on the posting of a bond by the appellant, except when that party is a federal government entity. Rule 9025 governs proceedings against sureties.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e) retains the provision of the former rule that authorizes the bankruptcy court to decide whether to suspend or allow the continuation of other proceedings in the bankruptcy case while the matter for which a stay has been sought is pending on appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. The clause “or where it will be taken” was deleted in subdivision (b)(1). Stylistic changes were made to the titles of subdivisions (b) and (e) and in subdivision (e)(1). A discussion of subdivision (e) was added to the Committee Note.</p>

Rule 62 formerly required a party to provide a “supersedeas bond” to obtain a stay of the judgment and proceedings to enforce the judgment. As amended, Rule 62(b) allows a party to obtain a stay by providing a “bond or other security.”</p>

It provides a procedure for the issuance of an indicative ruling when a bankruptcy court determines that, because of a pending appeal, the court lacks jurisdiction to grant a request for relief that the court concludes is meritorious or raises a substantial issue. The rule does not attempt to define the circumstances in which an appeal limits or defeats the bankruptcy court’s authority to act in the face of a pending appeal. In contrast, Rule 8002(b) identifies motions that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before the last such motion is resolved. In those circumstances, the bankruptcy court has authority to resolve the motion without resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) requires the movant to notify the court where an appeal is pending if the bankruptcy court states that it would grant the motion or that it raises a substantial issue. This provision applies to appeals pending in the district court, the BAP, or the court of appeals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 6 and 12.1 govern the procedure in the court of appeals following notification of the bankruptcy court’s indicative ruling.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) of this rule governs the procedure in the district court or BAP upon notification that the bankruptcy court has issued an indicative ruling. The district court or BAP may remand to the bankruptcy court for a ruling on the motion for relief. The district court or BAP may also remand all proceedings, thereby terminating the initial appeal, if it expressly states that it is dismissing the appeal. It should do so, however, only when the appellant has stated clearly its intention to abandon the appeal. Otherwise, the district court or BAP may remand for the purpose of ruling on the motion, while retaining jurisdiction to proceed with the appeal after the bankruptcy court rules, provided that the appeal is not then moot and a party wishes to proceed.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b80794c-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rule 8006 and F.R.App.P. 10 and 11(a). The provisions of this rule and Rule 8010 are applicable to appeals taken directly to a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2), as well as to appeals to a district court or BAP. <i>See</i> F.R.App.P. 6(c)(2)(A) and (B). </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule retains the practice of former Rule 8006 of requiring the parties to designate items to be included in the record on appeal. In this respect, the bankruptcy rule differs from the appellate rule. Among other things, F.R.App.P. 10(a) provides that the record on appeal consists of all the documents and exhibits filed in the case. This requirement would often be unworkable in a bankruptcy context because thousands of items might have been filed in the overall bankruptcy case. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) provides the time period for an appellant to file a designation of items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented. It then provides for the designation of additional items by the appellee, cross-appellant, and cross-appellee, as well as for the cross-appellant’s statement of the issues to be presented in its appeal. Subdivision (a)(4) prescribes the content of the record on appeal. Ordinarily, the bankruptcy clerk will not need to have paper copies of the designated items because the clerk will either transmit them to the appellate court electronically or otherwise make them available electronically. If the bankruptcy clerk requires a paper copy of some or all of the items designated as part of the record, the clerk may request the party that designated the item to provide the necessary copies, and the party must comply with the request or bear the cost of the clerk’s copying. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) governs the process for ordering a complete or partial transcript of the bankruptcy court proceedings. In situations in which a transcript is unavailable, subdivision (c) allows for the parties’ preparation of a statement of the evidence or proceedings, which must be approved by the bankruptcy court. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) adopts the practice of F.R.App.P. 10(d) of permitting the parties to agree on a statement of the case in place of the record on appeal. The statement must show how the issues on appeal arose and were decided in the bankruptcy court. It must be approved by the bankruptcy court in order to be certified as the record on appeal. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e), modeled on F.R.App.P. 10(e), provides a procedure for correcting the record on appeal if an item is improperly designated, omitted, or misstated. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) is a new provision that governs the handling of any document that remains sealed by the bankruptcy court and that a party wants to include in the record on appeal. The party must request the court where the appeal is pending to accept the document under seal, and that motion must be granted before the bankruptcy clerk may transmit the sealed document to the district, BAP, or circuit clerk. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (g) requires the parties’ cooperation with the bankruptcy clerk in assembling and transmitting the record. It retains the requirement of former Rule 8006, which was adapted from F.R.App.P. 11(a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. In subdivision (a)(2) and (3), the place of filing was clarified. “Docket entries kept by the bankruptcy clerk” was added to the list in subdivision (a)(4).</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b807968-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rule 8007 and F.R.App.P. 11. It applies to an appeal taken directly to a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2), as well as to an appeal to a district court or BAP. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) generally retains the procedure of former Rule 8007(a) regarding the reporter’s duty to prepare and file a transcript if a party requests one. It clarifies that the person or service that transcribes the recording of a proceeding is considered the reporter under this rule if the proceeding is recorded without a reporter being present in the courtroom. It also makes clear that the reporter must file with the bankruptcy court the acknowledgment of the request for a transcript and statement of the expected completion date, the completed transcript, and any request for an extension of time beyond 30 days for completion of the transcript. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) requires the bankruptcy clerk to transmit the record to the district, BAP or circuit clerk when the record is complete and, in the case of appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3), leave to appeal has been granted. This transmission will be made electronically, either by sending the record itself or sending notice that the record can be accessed electronically. The court where the appeal is pending may, however, require that a paper copy of some or all of the record be furnished, in which case the clerk of that court will direct the appellant to provide the copies. If the appellant does not do so, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare the copies at the appellant’s expense. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In a change from former Rule 8007(b), subdivision (b) of this rule no longer directs the clerk of the appellate court to docket the appeal upon receipt of the record from the bankruptcy clerk. Instead, under Rules 8003(d) and 8004(c) and F.R.App.P. 12(a), the district, BAP, or circuit clerk dockets the appeal upon receipt of the notice of appeal or, in the case of appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3), the notice of appeal and the motion for leave to appeal. Accordingly, by the time the district, BAP, or circuit clerk receives the record, the appeal will already be docketed in that court. The clerk of the appellate court must indicate on the docket and give notice to the parties to the appeal when the transmission of the record is received. Under Rule 8018(a) and F.R.App.P. 31, the briefing schedule is generally based on that date. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is derived from former Rule 8007(c) and F.R.App.P. 11(g). It provides for the transmission of parts of the record that the parties designate for consideration by the district court, BAP, or court of appeals in ruling on specified preliminary motions filed prior to the preparation and transmission of the record on appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. Subdivision (a)(1) was revised to more accurately reflect the way in which transcription services are selected. A cross-reference to Rule 8009(b) was added to subdivision (a)(2)(A).</p>

Rule 62 formerly required a party to provide a “supersedeas bond” to obtain a stay of the judgment and proceedings to enforce the judgment. As amended, Rule 62(b) allows a party to obtain a stay by providing a “bond or other security.”</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b807992-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rule 8008 and F.R.App.P. 25. It adopts some of the additional details of the appellate rule, and it provides greater recognition of the possibility of electronic filing and service. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) governs the filing of documents in the district court or BAP. Consistent with other provisions of these Part VIII rules, subdivision (a)(2) requires electronic filing of documents, including briefs and appendices, unless the district court’s or BAP’s procedures permit or require other methods of delivery to the court. An electronic filing is timely if it is received by the district or BAP clerk within the time fixed for filing. No additional copies need to be submitted when documents are filed electronically, by mail, or by delivery unless the district court or BAP requires them. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(3) provides that the district or BAP clerk may not refuse to accept a document for filing solely because its form does not comply with these rules or any local rule or practice. The district court or BAP may, however, direct the correction of any deficiency in any document that does not conform to the requirements of these rules or applicable local rules, and may prescribe such other relief as the court deems appropriate. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivisions (b) and (c) address the service of documents in the district court or BAP. Except for documents that the district or BAP clerk must serve, a party that makes a filing must serve copies of the document on the other parties to the appeal. Service on represented parties must be made on counsel. Subdivision (c) expresses the general requirement under these Part VIII rules that documents be sent electronically. <i>See</i> Rule 8001(c). Local court rules, however, may provide for other means of service, and subdivision (c) specifies non-electronic methods of service by or on an unrepresented party. Electronic service is complete upon transmission, unless the party making service receives notice that the transmission did not reach the person intended to be served in a readable form. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) retains the former rule’s provisions regarding proof of service of a document filed in the district court or BAP. In addition, it provides that a certificate of service must state the mail or electronic address or fax number to which service was made. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e) is a new provision that requires an electronic signature of counsel or an unrepresented filer for documents that are filed electronically in the district court or BAP. A local rule may specify a method of providing an electronic signature that is consistent with any standards established by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Paper copies of documents filed in the district court or BAP must bear an actual signature of counsel or the filer. By requiring a signature, subdivision (e) ensures that a readily identifiable attorney or party takes responsibility for every document that is filed.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b807993-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is amended to conform to the amendments to F.R.App.P. 25 on inmate filing, electronic filing, signature, service, and proof of service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Consistent with Rule 8001(c), subdivision (a)(2) generally makes electronic filing mandatory. The rule recognizes exceptions for persons proceeding without an attorney, exceptions for good cause, and variations established by local rule.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(2)(A)(iii) is revised to conform to F.R.App.P. 25(a)(2)(A)(iii), which was recently amended to streamline and clarify the operation of the inmate-filing rule. The rule requires the inmate to show timely deposit and prepayment of postage. It is amended to specify that a notice is timely if it is accompanied by a declaration or notarized statement stating the date the notice was deposited in the institution’s mail system and attesting to the prepayment of first-class postage. The declaration must state that first-class postage “is being prepaid,” not (as directed by the former rule) that first-class postage “has been prepaid.” This change reflects the fact that inmates may need to rely upon the institution to affix postage after the inmate has deposited the document in the institution’s mail system. A new Director’s Form sets out a suggested form of the declaration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amended rule also provides that a notice is timely without a declaration or notarized statement if other evidence accompanying the notice shows that the notice was deposited on or before the due date and that postage was prepaid. If the notice is not accompanied by evidence that establishes timely deposit and prepayment of postage, then the appellate court—district court, BAP, or court of appeals in the case of a direct appeal—has discretion to accept a declaration or notarized statement at a later date. The rule uses the phrase “exercises its discretion to permit”—rather than simply “permits”—to help ensure that pro se inmates are aware that a court will not necessarily forgive a failure to provide the declaration initially.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is amended to authorize electronic service by means of the court’s electronic-filing system on registered users without requiring their written consent. All other forms of electronic service require the written consent of the person served.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Service is complete when a person files the paper with the court’s electronic-filing system for transmission to a registered user, or when one person sends it to another person by other electronic means that the other person has consented to in writing. But service is not effective if the person who filed with the court or the person who sent by other agreed-upon electronic means receives notice that the paper did not reach the person to be served. The rule does not make the court responsible for notifying a person who filed the paper with the court’s electronic-filing system that an attempted transmission by the court’s system failed. But a filer who receives notice that the transmission failed is responsible for making effective service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As amended, subdivision (d) eliminates the requirement of proof of service when service is made through the electronic-filing system. The notice of electronic filing generated by the system serves that purpose.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e) requires the signature of counsel or an unrepresented party on every document that is filed. A filing made through a person’s electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person’s name on a signature block, constitutes the person’s signature. A person’s electronic-filing account means an account established by the court for use of the court’s electronic-filing system, which account the person accesses with the user name and password (or other credentials) issued to that person by the court.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b82e9e2-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rule 8011 and F.R.App.P. 15(d) and 27. It adopts many of the provisions of the appellate rules that specify the form and page limits of motions and accompanying documents, while also adjusting those requirements for electronic filing. In addition, it prescribes the procedure for seeking to intervene in the district court or BAP. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) retains much of the content of former Rule 8011(a) regarding the contents of a motion, response, and reply. It also specifies the documents that may accompany a motion. Unlike the former rule, which allowed the filing of separate briefs supporting a motion, subdivision (a) now adopts the practice of F.R.App.P. 27(a) of prohibiting the filing of briefs supporting or responding to a motion. The motion or response itself must include the party’s legal arguments. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(2)(B) clarifies the procedure for seeking to expedite an appeal. A motion under this provision seeks to expedite the time for the disposition of the appeal as a whole, whereas an emergency motion—which is addressed by subdivision (d)—typically involves an urgent request for relief short of disposing of the entire appeal (for example, an emergency request for a stay pending appeal to prevent imminent mootness). In appropriate cases—such as when there is an urgent need to resolve the appeal quickly to prevent harm—a party may file a motion to expedite the appeal as an emergency motion. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) retains the substance of former Rule 8011(b). It authorizes the district court or BAP to act on a motion for a procedural order without awaiting a response to the motion. It specifies that a party seeking reconsideration, vacation, or modification of the order must file a motion within 7 days after service of the order. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) continues the practice of former Rule 8011(c) and F.R.App.P. 27(e) of dispensing with oral argument of motions in the district court or BAP unless the court orders otherwise. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d), which carries forward the content of former Rule 8011(d), governs emergency motions that the district court or BAP may rule on without awaiting a response when necessary to prevent irreparable harm. A party seeking expedited action on a motion in the district court or BAP must explain the nature of the emergency, whether all grounds in support of the motion were first presented to the bankruptcy court, and, if not, why the district court or BAP should not remand for reconsideration. The moving party must also explain the steps taken to notify opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties in advance of filing the emergency motion and, if they were not notified, why it was impracticable to do so. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e), like former Rule 8011(e) and similar to F.R.App.P. 27(c), authorizes a single BAP judge to rule on certain motions. This authority, however, does not extend to issuing rulings that would dispose of the appeal. For that reason, the rule now prohibits a single BAP judge from denying a motion for a stay pending appeal when the effect of that ruling would be to require dismissal of the appeal as moot. A ruling by a single judge is subject to review by the BAP. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) incorporates by reference the formatting and appearance requirements of F.R.App.P. 27(d)(1). When paper versions of the listed documents are filed, they must comply with the requirements of the specified rules regarding reproduction, covers, binding, appearance, and format. When these documents are filed electronically, they must comply with the relevant requirements of the specified rules regarding covers and format. Subdivision (f) also specifies page limits for motions, responses, and replies, which is a matter that former Rule 8011 did not address. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (g) clarifies the procedure for seeking to intervene in a proceeding that has been appealed. It is based on F.R.App.P. 15(d), but it also requires the moving party to explain why intervention is being sought at the appellate stage. The former Part VIII rules did not address intervention.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. Subdivision (a)(2)(D) was changed to allow the court to require a notice of motion or proposed order. A stylistic change was made to subdivision (d)(2)(B).</p>

The word limits were derived from the current page limits, using the assumption that one page is equivalent to 260 words. Documents produced using a computer must include the certificate of compliance required by Rule 8015(h); Official Form 417C suffices to meet that requirement. Page limits are retained for papers prepared without the aid of a computer (i.e., handwritten or typewritten papers). For both the word limit and the page limit, the calculation excludes the accompanying documents required by Rule 8013(a)(2)(C) and any items listed in Rule 8015(h).</p>

Adopting much of the content of Rule 28, it provides greater detail than former Rule 8010 contained regarding appellate briefs. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) prescribes the content and structure of the appellant’s brief. It largely follows former Rule 8010(a)(1), but, to ensure national uniformity, it eliminates the provision authorizing a district court or BAP to alter these requirements. Subdivision (a)(1) provides that when Rule 8012 requires an appellant to file a corporate disclosure statement, it must be placed at the beginning of the appellant’s brief. Subdivision (a)(10) is new. It implements the requirement under Rule 8015(a)(7)(C) and (b) for the filing of a certificate of compliance with the limit on the number of words or lines allowed to be in a brief.  </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) carries forward the provisions of former Rule 8010(a)(2). </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) is derived from F.R.App.P. 28(c). It authorizes an appellant to file a reply brief, which will generally complete the briefing process. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) is similar to former Rule 8010(b), but it is reworded to reflect the likelihood that briefs will generally be filed electronically rather than in paper form. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e) mirrors F.R.App.P. 28(i). It authorizes multiple appellants or appellees to join in a single brief. It also allows a party to incorporate by reference portions of another party’s brief. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) adopts the procedures of F.R.App.P. 28(j) with respect to the filing of supplemental authorities with the district court or BAP after a brief has been filed or after oral argument. Unlike the appellate rule, it specifies a period of 7 days for filing a response to a submission of supplemental authorities. The supplemental submission and response must comply with the signature requirements of Rule 8011(e). </p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b82ea2f-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived primarily from F.R.App.P. 32. Former Rule 8010(c) prescribed page limits for principal briefs and reply briefs. Those limits are now addressed by subdivision (a)(7) of this rule. In addition, the rule incorporates most of the detail of F.R.App.P. 32 regarding the appearance and format of briefs, appendices, and other documents, along with new provisions that apply when those documents are filed electronically. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) prescribes the form requirements for briefs that are filed in paper form. It incorporates F.R.App.P. 32(a), except it does not include color requirements for brief covers, it requires the cover of a brief to include counsel’s e-mail address, and cross-references to the appropriate bankruptcy rules are substituted for references to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(7) decreases the length of briefs, as measured by the number of pages, that was permitted by former Rule 8010(c). Page limits are reduced from 50 to 30 pages for a principal brief and from 25 to 15 for a reply brief in order to achieve consistency with F.R.App.P. 32(a)(7). But as permitted by the appellate rule, subdivision (a)(7) also permits the limits on the length of a brief to be measured by a word or line count, as an alternative to a page limit. Basing the calculation of brief length on either of the type-volume methods specified in subdivision (a)(7)(B) will result in briefs that may exceed the designated page limits in (a)(7)(A) and that may be approximately as long as allowed by the prior page limits. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) adapts for briefs that are electronically filed subdivision (a)’s form requirements. With the use of electronic filing, the method of reproduction, method of binding, and use of paper become irrelevant. But information required on the cover, formatting requirements, and limits on brief length remain the same. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivisions (c) and (d) prescribe the form requirements for appendices. Subdivision (c), applicable to paper appendices, is derived from F.R.App.P. 32(b), and subdivision (d) adapts those requirements for electronically filed appendices. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e), which is based on F.R.App.P. 32(c), addresses the form required for documents—in paper form or electronically filed—that these rules do not otherwise cover.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f), like F.R.App.P. 32(e), provides assurance to lawyers and parties that compliance with this rule’s form requirements will allow a brief or other document to be accepted by any district court or BAP. A court may, however, by local rule or, under Rule 8028 by order in a particular case, choose to accept briefs and documents that do not comply with all of this rule’s requirements. The decision whether to accept a brief that appears not to be in compliance with the rules must be made by the court. Under Rule 8011(a)(3), the clerk may not refuse to accept a document for filing solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or any local rule or practice. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under Rule 8011(e), the party filing the document or, if represented, its counsel must sign all briefs and other submissions. If the document is filed electronically, an electronic signature must be provided in accordance with Rule 8011(e). </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. In subdivision (f), “or order in a particular case” was deleted as unnecessary. The discussion in the Committee Note about brief lengths was revised, and the discussion of subdivision (f) was expanded.</p>
</note>
<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b82ea30-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is amended to conform to recent amendments to F.R.App.P. 32, which reduced the word limits generally allowed for briefs. When Rule 32(a)(7)(B)’s type-volume limits for briefs were adopted in 1998, the word limits were based on an estimate of 280 words per page. Amended F.R.App.P. 32 applies a conversion ratio of 260 words per page and reduces the word limits accordingly. Rule 8015(a)(7) adopts the same reduced word limits for briefs prepared by computer.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In a complex case, a party may need to file a brief that exceeds the type-volume limitations specified in these rules, such as to include unusually voluminous information explaining relevant background or legal provisions or to respond to multiple briefs by opposing parties or amici. The Committee expects that courts will accommodate those situations by granting leave to exceed the type-volume limitations as appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) is amended to make clear a court’s ability (by local rule or order in a case) to increase the length limits for briefs and other documents. Subdivision (f) already established this authority as to the length limits in Rule 8015(a)(7); the amendment makes clear that this authority extends to all length limits in Part VIII of the Bankruptcy Rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A new subdivision (g) is added to set out a global list of items excluded from length computations, and the list of exclusions in former subdivision (a)(7)(B)(iii) is deleted. The certificate-of-compliance provision formerly in subdivision (a)(7)(C) is relocated to a new subdivision (h) and now applies to filings under all type-volume limits (other than Rule 8014(f)’s word limit)—including the new word limits in Rules 8013, 8016, 8017, and 8022. Conforming amendments are made to Official Form 417C.</p>

Because each item listed in Rule 8015(g) will not always be required, the initial article is deleted. The word “corporate” is deleted before “disclosure statement” to reflect a concurrent change in the title of Rule 8012.</p>

It governs the timing, content, length, filing, and service of briefs in bankruptcy appeals in which there is a cross-appeal. The former Part VIII rules did not separately address the topic of cross-appeals. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (b) prescribes which party is designated the appellant when there is a cross-appeal. Generally, the first to file a notice of appeal will be the appellant. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c) specifies the briefs that the appellant and the appellee may file. Because of the dual role of the parties to the appeal and cross-appeal, each party is permitted to file a principal brief and a response to the opposing party’s brief, as well as a reply brief. For the appellee, the principal brief in the cross-appeal and the response in the appeal are combined into a single brief. The appellant, on the other hand, initially files a principal brief in the appeal and later files a response to the appellee’s principal brief in the cross-appeal, along with a reply brief in the appeal. The final brief that may be filed is the appellee’s reply brief in the cross-appeal. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d), which prescribes page limits for briefs, is adopted from F.R.App.P. 28.1(e). It applies to briefs that are filed electronically, as well as to those filed in paper form.

When Rule 28.1 was adopted in 2005, it modeled its type-volume limits on those set forth in F.R.App.P. 32(a)(7) for briefs in cases that did not involve a cross-appeal. At that time, Rule 32(a)(7)(B) set word limits based on an estimate of 280 words per page. Amended F.R.App.P. 32 and 28.1 apply a conversion ratio of 260 words per page and reduce the word limits accordingly. Rule 8016(d)(2) adopts the same reduced word limits.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In a complex case, a party may need to file a brief that exceeds the type-volume limitations specified in these rules, such as to include unusually voluminous information explaining relevant background or legal provisions or to respond to multiple briefs by opposing parties or amici. The Committee expects that courts will accommodate those situations by granting leave to exceed the type-volume limitations as appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) is amended to refer to new Rule 8015(h) (which now contains the certificate-of-compliance provision formerly in Rule 8015(a)(7)(C)).</p>

Former Rule 8017 is renumbered Rule 8017(a), and language is added to that subdivision (a) to state that its provisions apply to amicus filings during the district court’s or BAP’s initial consideration of a case on the merits. New subdivision (b) is added to address amicus filings in connection with a motion for rehearing. Subdivision (b) sets default rules that apply when a district court or BAP does not provide otherwise by local rule or by order in a case. A court remains free to adopt different rules governing whether amicus filings are permitted in connection with motions for rehearing and the procedures when such filings are permitted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendment to subdivision (a)(2) authorizes orders or local rules that prohibit the filing of or permit the striking of an amicus brief by party consent if the brief would result in a judge’s disqualification. The amendment does not alter or address the standards for when an amicus brief requires a judge’s disqualification. It is modeled on an amendment to F.R.App.P. 29(a). A comparable amendment to subdivision (b) is not necessary. Subdivision (b)(1) authorizes local rules and orders governing filings during a court’s consideration of whether to grant rehearing. These local rules or orders may prohibit the filing of or permit the striking of an amicus brief that would result in a judge’s disqualification. In addition, under subdivision (b)(2), a court may deny leave to file an amicus brief that would result in a judge’s disqualification.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b853384-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2014</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule is derived from former Rule 8009 and F.R.App.P. 30 and 31. Like former Rule 8009, it addresses the timing of serving and filing briefs and appendices, as well as the content and format of appendices. Rule 8011 governs the methods of filing and serving briefs and appendices. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule retains the bankruptcy practice of permitting the appellee to file its own appendix, rather than requiring the appellant to include in its appendix matters designated by the appellee. Rule 8016 governs the timing of serving and filing briefs when a cross-appeal is taken. This rule’s provisions about appendices apply to all appeals, including cross-appeals. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) retains former Rule 8009’s provision that allows the district court or BAP to dispense with briefing or to provide different time periods than this rule specifies. It increases some of the time periods for filing briefs from the periods prescribed by the former rule, while still retaining shorter time periods than some provided by F.R.App.P. 31(a). The time for filing the appellant’s brief is increased from 14 to 30 days after the docketing of the notice of the transmission of the record or notice of the availability of the record. That triggering event is equivalent to docketing the appeal under former Rule 8007. Appellate Rule 31(a)(1), by contrast, provides the appellant 40 days after the record is filed to file its brief. The shorter time period for bankruptcy appeals reflects the frequent need for greater expedition in the resolution of bankruptcy appeals, while still providing the appellant more time to prepare its brief than the former rule provided. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(2) similarly expands the time period for filing the appellee’s brief from 14 to 30 days after the service of the appellant’s brief. This period is the same as F.R.App.P. 31(a)(1) provides. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(3) retains the 14-day time period for filing a reply brief that the former rule prescribed, but it qualifies that period to ensure that the final brief is filed at least 7 days before oral argument. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If a district court or BAP has a mediation procedure for bankruptcy appeals, that procedure could affect when briefs must be filed. <i>See</i> Rule 8027. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(4) is new. Based on F.R.App.P. 31(c), it provides for actions that may be taken—dismissal of the appeal or denial of participation in oral argument—if the appellant or appellee fails to file its brief. </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivisions (b) and (c) govern the content and format of the appendix to a brief. Subdivision (b) is similar to former Rule 8009(b), and subdivision (c) is derived from F.R.App.P. 30(d). </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d), which addresses the inclusion of exhibits in the appendix, is derived from F.R.App.P. 30(e). </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. Subdivision (a)(4) was revised to provide more detail about the procedure for dismissing an appeal due to appellant’s failure to timely file a brief.</p>

It is added to prevent a district court from having to remand an appeal whenever it determines that the bankruptcy court lacked constitutional authority to enter the judgment, order, or decree appealed from. Consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison</i>, 134 S. Ct. 2165 (2014), the district court in that situation may treat the bankruptcy court’s judgment as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Upon making the determination to proceed in that manner, the district court may choose to allow the parties to file written objections to specific proposed findings and conclusions and to respond to another party’s objections, <i>see</i> Rule 9033; treat the parties’ briefs as objections and responses; or prescribe other procedures for the review of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>

The rule also incorporates some of the additional details regarding the taxing of costs contained in F.R.App.P. 39. Consistent with former Rule 8014, the bankruptcy clerk has the responsibility for taxing all costs. Subdivision (b), derived from F.R.App.P. 39(b), clarifies that additional authority is required for the taxation of costs by or against federal governmental parties. </p>

The provision of the former rule regarding dismissal of appeals in the bankruptcy court prior to docketing of the appeal has been deleted. Now that docketing occurs promptly after a notice of appeal is filed, <i>see</i> Rules 8003(d) and 8004(c), an appeal likely will not be voluntarily dismissed before docketing.  </p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule retains the provision of the former rule that the district or BAP clerk must dismiss an appeal upon the parties’ agreement. District courts and BAPs continue to have discretion to dismiss an appeal on an appellant’s motion. Nothing in the rule prohibits a district court or BAP from dismissing an appeal for other reasons authorized by law, such as the failure to prosecute an appeal. </p>

When a public officer who is a party to an appeal or other proceeding in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action does not abate. Subject to Rule 2012, the public officer’s successor is automatically substituted as a party. Proceedings after the substitution are to be in the name of the substituted party, but any misnomer that does not affect the parties’ substantial rights may be disregarded. An order of substitution may be entered at any time, but failure to enter an order does not affect the substitution.</content>

A notice provider is an entity approved by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to enter into agreements with entities to give notice to those entities in the form and manner agreed to by those parties. The new definition supports the amendment to Rule 2002(g)(4) that authorizes a notice provider to give notices under Rule 2002.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Many entities conduct business on a national scale and receive vast numbers of notices in bankruptcy cases throughout the country. Those entities can agree with a notice provider to receive their notices in a form and at an address or addresses that the creditor and notice provider agree upon. There are processes currently in use that provide substantial assurance that notices are not misdirected. Any notice provider would have to demonstrate to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that it could provide the service in a manner that ensures the proper delivery of notice to creditors. Once the Administrative Office of the United States Courts approves the notice provider to enter into agreements with creditors, the notice provider and other entities can establish the relationship that will govern the delivery of notices in cases as provided in Rule 2002(g)(4).</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b87a485-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. This rule is an adaptation of Rule 6 F.R.Civ.P. It governs the time for acts to be done and proceedings to be had in cases under the Code and any litigation arising therein.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is patterned after Rule 6(b) F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 26(b) F.R.App.P.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (1) of this subdivision confers on the court discretion generally to authorize extensions of time for doing acts required or allowed by these rules or orders of court. The exceptions to this general authority to extend the time are contained in paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the interest of prompt administration of bankruptcy cases certain time periods may not be extended. Paragraph (2) lists the rules which establish time periods which may not be extended: Rule 1007(d), time for filing a list of 20 largest creditors; Rule 1017(b)(3), 30 day period for sending notice of dismissal for failure to pay the filing fee; Rule 1019(2), 20 day period for notice of conversion to a chapter 7 case; Rule 2003(a), meeting of creditors not more than 40 days after order for relief; Rule 2003(d), 10 days for filing a motion for resolution of an election dispute; Rule 3014, time for the § 1111(b)(2) election; Rule 4001(b), expiration of stay 30 days following the commencement of final hearing; Rule 7052(b), 10 day period to move to amend findings of fact; Rule 9015(f), 20 day period to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; Rule 9023, 10 day period to move for a new trial; and Rule 9024, time to move for relief from judgment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Many rules which establish a time for doing an act also contain a specific authorization and standard for granting an extension of time and, in some cases, limit the length of an extension. In some instances it would be inconsistent with the objective of the rule and sound administration of the case to permit extension under Rule 9006(b)(1), but with respect to the other rules it is appropriate that the power to extend time be supplemented by Rule 9006(b)(1). Unless a rule which contains a specific authorization to extend time is listed in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, an extension of the time may be granted under paragraph (1) of this subdivision. If a rule is included in paragraph (3) an extension may not be granted under paragraph (1). The following rules are listed in paragraph (3): Rule 1006(b)(2), time for paying the filing fee in installments; Rule 3002(c), 90 day period for filing a claim in a chapter 7 or 13 case; Rule 4003(b), 30 days for filing objections to a claim of exemptions; Rule 4004(a), 60 day period to object to a discharge; Rule 4007(b), 60 day period to file a dischargeability complaint; and Rule 8002, 10 days for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. Paragraph (1) of this subdivision authorizes the reduction of the time periods established by these rules or an order of the court. Excluded from this general authority are the time periods established by the rules referred to in paragraph (2) of the subdivision: Rule 2002 (a) and (b), 20 day and 25 day notices of certain hearings and actions in the case; Rule 2003(a), meeting of creditors to be not less than 20 days after the order for relief; Rule 3002(c), 90 days for filing a claim in a chapter 7 or 13 case; Rule 3014, time for § 1111(b)(2) election; Rule 3015, 10 day period after filing of petition to file a chapter 13 plan; Rule 4003(a), 15 days for a dependent to claim exemptions; Rule 4004(a), 60 day period to object to a discharge; Rule 4007(c), 60 day period to file a dischargeability complaint; and Rule 8002, 10 days for filing a notice of appeal. Reduction of the time periods fixed in the rules referred to in this subdivision would be inconsistent with the purposes of those rules and would cause harmful uncertainty.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is derived from Rule 6(d) F.R.Civ.P. The reference is to Rule 9023 instead of to Rule 59(c) F.R.Civ.P. because Rule 9023 incorporates Rule 59 F.R.Civ.P. but excepts therefrom motions to reconsider orders allowing and disallowing claims.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (f)</i> is new and is the same as Rule 6(e) F.R.Civ.P.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. The reference to Rule 4001(b) in paragraph (3) is deleted because of the amendments made to Rule 4001. Rule 9033, which is new, contains specific provisions governing the extension of time to file objections to proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Rule 9033 is added to the rules referred to in paragraph (3).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i>. Rule 4001(b)(2) and (c)(2) provide that a final hearing on a motion to use cash collateral or a motion for authority to obtain credit may be held no earlier than 15 days after the filing of the motion. These two rules are added to paragraph (2) to make it clear that the 15 day period may not be reduced. Rule 9033 is also added to paragraph (2).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (g)</i> is new. Under § 557 of the Code, as enacted by the 1984 amendments, the court is directed to expedite grain storage facility cases. This subdivision makes it clear this rule does not limit the court’s authority under § 557.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The original Advisory Committee Note to this rule included the 25 day notice period of Rule 2002(b) as a time period which may not be reduced under Rule 9006(c)(2). This was an error.</p>

This rule was amended in 1987 to conform to Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) which provides for the exclusion of intermediate weekends and legal holidays if the time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days. An undesirable result of the 1987 amendment was that 10-day time periods prescribed in the interest of prompt administration of bankruptcy cases were extended to at least 14 calendar days.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As a result of the present amendment, 10-day time periods prescribed or allowed will no longer be extended to at least 14 calendar days because of intermediate weekends and legal holidays.</p>

The proposed amendments to Rule 1019(6) have been changed so that the court will fix the time for filing the request for payment. Since the court will fix the time limit, the court should have the power to reduce it. <i>See</i> GAP Report to Rule 1019(6).</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b87a48c-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 9006(f) is amended, consistent with a corresponding amendment to Rule 6(e) of the F.R. Civ. P., to clarify the method of counting the number of days to respond after service either by mail or under Civil Rule 5(b)(2)(C) or (D). Three days are added after the prescribed period expires. If, before the application of Rule 9006(f), the prescribed period is less than 8 days, intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from the calculation under Rule 9006(a). Some illustrations may be helpful.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under existing Rule 9006(a), assuming that there are no legal holidays and that a response is due in seven days, if a paper is filed on a Monday, the seven day response period commences on Tuesday and concludes on Wednesday of the next week. Adding three days to the end of the period would extend it to Saturday, but because the response period ends on a weekend, the response day would be the following Monday, two weeks after the filing of the initial paper. If the paper is filed on a Tuesday, the seven-day response period would end on the following Thursday, and the response time would also be the following Monday. If the paper is mailed on a Wednesday, the initial seven-day period would expire nine days later on a Friday, but the response would again be due on the following Monday because of Rule 9006(f). If the paper is mailed on a Thursday, however, the seven day period ends on Monday, eleven days after the mailing of the service because of the exclusion of the two intervening Saturdays and Sundays. The response is due three days later on the following Thursday. If the paper is mailed on a Friday, the seven day period would conclude on a Tuesday, and the response is due three days later on a Friday.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">No other change in the system of counting time is intended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Other changes are stylistic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</i>. The phrase “would otherwise expire under Rule 9006(a)” was added to the end of the rule to clarify further that the three day extension is to be added to the end of the period that is established under the counting provisions of Rule 9006(a). This also maintains a parallel construction with Civil Rule 6(e) in which the same addition to the rule was made after the public comment period.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b87a48e-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2009 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. Subdivision (a) has been amended to simplify and clarify the provisions that describe how deadlines are computed. Subdivision (a) governs the computation of any time period found in a Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure, a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, a statute, a local rule, or a court order. In accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 9029(a), a local rule may not direct that a deadline be computed in a manner inconsistent with subdivision (a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The time-computation provisions of subdivision (a) apply only when a time period must be computed. They do not apply when a fixed time to act is set. The amendments thus carry forward the approach taken in <i>Violette v. P.A. Days, Inc.</i>, 427 F.3d 1015, 1016 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that Civil Rule 6(a) “does not apply to situations where the court has established a specific calendar day as a deadline”), and reject the contrary holding of <i>In re American Healthcare Management, Inc.</i>, 900 F.2d 827, 832 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) governs treatment of date-certain deadline set by court order). If, for example, the date for filing is “no later than <date date="2007-11-01">November 1, 2007</date>,” subdivision (a) does not govern. But if a filing is required to be made “within 10 days” or “within 72 hours,” subdivision (a) describes how that deadline is computed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) does not apply when computing a time period set by a statute if the statute specifies a method of computing time. <i>See, e.g.</i>, 11 U.S.C. § 527(a)(2) (debt relief agencies must provide a written notice to an assisted person “not later than 3 business days” after providing bankruptcy assistance services).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(1)</i>. New subdivision (a)(1) addresses the computation of time periods that are stated in days. It also applies to time periods that are stated in weeks, months, or years. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(c)(1) made applicable to bankruptcy cases under Rule 9024. Subdivision (a)(1)(B)’s directive to “count every day” is relevant only if the period is stated in days (not weeks, months, or years).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under former Rule 9006(a), a period of eight days or more was computed differently than a period of less than eight days. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays were included in computing the longer periods, but excluded in computing the shorter periods. Former Rule 9006(a) thus made computing deadlines unnecessarily complicated and led to counterintuitive results.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under new subdivision (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days (no matter the length) are computed in the same way. The day of the event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other days—including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays—are counted, with only one exception: If the period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. An illustration is provided below in the discussion of subdivision (a)(5). Subdivision (a)(3) addresses filing deadlines that expire on a day when the clerk’s office is inaccessible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Where subdivision (a) formerly referred to the “act, event, or default” that triggers the deadline, new subdivision (a) refers simply to the “event” that triggers the deadline; this change in terminology is adopted for brevity and simplicity, and is not intended to change meaning.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Periods previously expressed as less than eight days will be shortened as a practical matter by the decision to count intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in computing all periods. Many of those periods have been lengthened to compensate for the change. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Rules 2008 (trustee’s duty to notify court of acceptance of the appointment within five days is extended to seven days); 6004(b) (time for filing and service of objection to proposed use, sale or lease of property extended from five days prior to the hearing to seven days prior to the hearing); and 9006(d) (time for giving notice of a hearing extended from five days prior to the hearing to seven days).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Most of the 10-day periods were adjusted to meet the change in computation method by setting 14 days as the new period. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Rules 1007(h) (10-day period to file supplemental schedule for property debtor becomes entitled to acquire after the commencement of the case is extended to 14 days); 3020(e) (10-day stay of order confirming a chapter 11 plan extended to 14 days); 8002(a) (10-day period in which to file notice of appeal extended to 14 days). A 14-day period also has the advantage that the final day falls on the same day of the week as the event that triggered the period—the14th day after a Monday, for example, is a Monday. This advantage of using week-long periods led to adopting seven-day periods to replace some of the periods set at less than 10 days, 21-day periods to replace 20-day periods, and 28-day periods to replace 25-day periods.Thirty-day and longer periods, however, were generally retained without change.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(2)</i>. New subdivision (a)(2) addresses the computation of time periods that are stated in hours. No such deadline currently appears in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. But some statutes contain deadlines stated in hours, as do some court orders issued in expedited proceedings.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under subdivision (a)(2), a deadline stated in hours starts to run immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the deadline. The deadline generally ends when the time expires. If, however, the time period expires at a specific time (say, 2:17 p.m.) on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline is extended to the same time (2:17 p.m.) on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Periods stated in hours are not to be “rounded up” to the next whole hour. Subdivision (a)(3) addresses situations when the clerk’s office is inaccessible during the last hour before a filing deadline expires.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(2)(B) directs that every hour be counted. Thus, for example, a 72-hour period that commences at 10:23 a.m. on Friday, <date date="2007-11-02">November 2, 2007</date>, will run until 9:23 a.m. on Monday, November 5; the discrepancy in start and end times in this example results from the intervening shift from daylight saving time to standard time.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(3)</i>. When determining the last day of a filing period stated in days or a longer unit of time, a day on which the clerk’s office is not accessible because of the weather or another reason is treated like a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When determining the end of a filing period stated in hours, if the clerk’s office is inaccessible during the last hour of the filing period computed under subdivision (a)(2) then the period is extended to the same time on the next day that is not a weekend, holiday, or day when the clerk’s office is inaccessible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a)(3)’s extensions apply “[u]nless the court orders otherwise.” In some circumstances, the court might not wish a period of inaccessibility to trigger a full 24-hour extension; in those instances, the court can specify a briefer extension.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The text of the rule no longer refers to “weather or other conditions” as the reason for the inaccessibility of the clerk’s office. The reference to “weather” was deleted from the text to underscore that inaccessibility can occur for reasons unrelated to weather, such as an outage of the electronic filing system. Weather can still be a reason for inaccessibility of the clerk’s office. The rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility. Rather, the concept will continue to develop through caselaw. <i>See, e.g.</i>, William G. Phelps, <i>When Is Office of Clerk of Court Inaccessible Due to Weather or Other Conditions for Purpose of Computing Time Period for Filing Papers under Rule 6(a) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, 135 A.L.R. Fed. 259 (1996) (collecting cases). In addition, many local provisions address inaccessibility for purposes of electronic filing. <i>See, e.g.</i>, D. Kan. Rule 5.4.11 (“A Filing User whose filing is made untimely as the result of a technical failure may seek appropriate relief from the court.”).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(4)</i>. New subdivision (a)(4) defines the end of the last day of a period for purposes of subdivision (a)(1). Subdivision (a)(4) does not apply in computing periods stated in hours under subdivision (a)(2), and does not apply if a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or order in the case. A local rule may provide, for example, that papers filed in a drop box after the normal hours of the clerk’s office are filed as of the day that is date-stamped on the papers by a device in the drop box.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">28 U.S.C. § 452 provides that “[a]ll courts of the United States shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing proper papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and orders.” A corresponding provision exists in Rule 5001(a). Some courts have held that these provisions permit an after-hours filing by handing the papers to an appropriate official. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Casalduc v. Diaz</i>, 117 F.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir. 1941). Subdivision (a)(4) does not address the effect of the statute on the question of after-hours filing; instead, the rule is designed to deal with filings in the ordinary course without regard to Section 452.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(5)</i>. New subdivision (a)(5) defines the “next” day for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C). The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure contain both forward-looking time periods and backward-looking time periods. A forward-looking time period requires something to be done within a period of time <i>after</i> an event. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Rules 1007(c) ([“]the schedules, statements, and other documents shall be filed by the debtor within 14 days of the entry of the order for relief”); 1019(5)(B)(ii) (“the trustee, not later than 30 days after conversion of the case, shall file and transmit to the United States trustee a final report and account”); and 7012(a) (“If a complaint is duly served, the defendant shall serve an answer within 30 days after the issuance of the summons, except when a different time is prescribed by the court.”).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A backward-looking time period requires something to be done within a period of time <i>before</i> an event. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Rules 6004(b) (“an objection to a proposed use, sale, or lease of property shall be filed and served not less than seven days before the date set for the proposed action”); 9006(d) (“A written motion, other than one which may be heard ex parte, and notice of any hearing shall be served not later than seven days before the time specified for such hearing”). In determining what is the “next” day for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C), one should continue counting in the same direction—that is, forward when computing a forward-looking period and backward when computing a backward-looking period. If, for example, a filing is due within 10 days <i>after</i> an event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday, <date date="2007-09-01">September 1, 2007</date>, then the filing is due on Tuesday, <date date="2007-09-04">September 4, 2007</date> (Monday, September 3, is Labor Day). But if a filing is due 10 days <i>before</i> an event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday, September 1, then the filing is due on Friday, August 31.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(6)</i>. New subdivision (a)(6) defines “legal holiday” for purposes of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, including the time-computation provisions of subdivision (a). Subdivision (a)(6) continues to include within the definition of “legal holiday” days that are declared a holiday by the President or Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">For forward-counted periods—<i>i.e.</i>, periods that are measured after an event—subdivision (a)(6)(C) includes certain state holidays within the definition of legal holidays, and defines the term “state”—for purposes of subdivision (a)(6)—to include the District of Columbia and any commonwealth or territory of the United States. Thus, for purposes of subdivision (a)(6)’s definition of “legal holiday,” “state” includes the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">However, state legal holidays are not recognized in computing backward-counted periods. For both forward- and backward-counted periods, the rule thus protects those who may be unsure of the effect of state holidays. For forward-counted deadlines, treating state holidays the same as federal holidays extends the deadline. Thus, someone who thought that the federal courts might be closed on a state holiday would be safeguarded against an inadvertent late filing. In contrast, for backward-counted deadlines, not giving state holidays the treatment of federal holidays allows filing on the state holiday itself rather than the day before. Take, for example, Monday, <date date="2008-04-21">April 21, 2008</date> (Patriot’s Day, a legal holiday in the relevant state). If a filing is due 14 days after an event, and the fourteenth day is April 21, then the filing is due on Tuesday, April 22 because Monday, April 21 counts as a legal holiday. But if a filing is due 14 days before an event, and the fourteenth day is April 21, the filing is due on Monday, April 21; the fact that April 21 is a state holiday does not make April 21 a legal holiday for purposes of computing this backward-counted deadline. But note that if the clerk’s office is inaccessible on Monday, April 21, then subdivision (a)(3) extends the April 21 filing deadline forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday—no earlier than Tuesday, April 22.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication</i>. The reference to Rule 6(a)(1) in subdivision (a)(3)(A) at line 50 of the rule as it was published was corrected by referring instead to Rule 9006(a)(1).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Standing Committee changed Rule 9006(a)(6) to exclude state holidays from the definition of “legal holiday” for purposes of computing backward-counted periods; conforming changes were made to the Committee Note to subdivision (a)(6). In addition, the term “possession” was deleted from the definition of “state” in subdivision (a)(6), and a conforming change was made to the Committee Note.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">[<i>Subdivision (d)</i>.] The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 15-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 20-day periods become 21-day periods</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">• 25-day periods become 28-day periods</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) is amended to conform to the changes made to Rule 5(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a part of the Civil Rules Restyling Project. As a part of that project, subparagraphs (b)(2)(C) and (D) of that rule were rewritten as subparagraphs (b)(2)(D), (E), and (F). The cross reference to those rules contained in subdivision (f) of this rule is corrected by this amendment.</p>

These time periods apply unless another Bankruptcy Rule or a court order, including a local rule, prescribes different time periods.

Rule 9014 prescribes the procedures applicable to contested matters, including the method of serving motions commencing contested matters and subsequent papers. Subdivision (d) is amended to apply to any written response to a motion, rather than just to opposing affidavits. The caption of the subdivision is amended to reflect this change.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 9006(f) and Civil Rule 6(d) contain similar provisions providing additional time for actions after being served by mail or by certain modes of service that are identified by reference to Civil Rule 5(b)(2). Rule 9006(f)—like Civil Rule 6(d)—is amended to remove the reference to service by electronic means under Rule 5(b)(2)(E). The amendment also adds clarifying parentheticals identifying the forms of service under Rule 5(b)(2) for which three days will still be added.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Civil Rule 5(b)—made applicable in bankruptcy proceedings by Rules 7005 and 9014(b)—was amended in 2001 to allow service by electronic means with the consent of the person served. Although electronic transmission seemed virtually instantaneous even then, electronic service was included in the modes of service that allow three added days to act after being served. There were concerns that the transmission might be delayed for some time, and particular concerns that incompatible systems might make it difficult or impossible to open attachments. Those concerns have been substantially alleviated by advances in technology and widespread skill in using electronic transmission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A parallel reason for allowing the three added days was that electronic service was authorized only with the consent of the person to be served. Concerns about the reliability of electronic transmission might have led to refusals of consent; the three added days were calculated to alleviate these concerns.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Diminution of the concerns that prompted the decision to allow the three added days for electronic transmission is not the only reason for discarding this indulgence. Many rules have been changed to ease the task of computing time by adopting 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-day periods that allow “day-of-the-week” counting. Adding three days at the end complicated the counting, and increased the occasions for further complication by invoking the provisions that apply when the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Electronic service after business hours, or just before or during a weekend or holiday, may result in a practical reduction in the time available to respond. Extensions of time may be warranted to prevent prejudice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Eliminating Rule 5(b) subparagraph (2)(E) from the modes of service that allow three added days means that the three added days cannot be retained by consenting to service by electronic means. Consent to electronic service in registering for electronic case filing, for example, does not count as consent to service “by any other means” of delivery under subparagraph (F).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (f) is also amended to conform to a corresponding amendment of Civil Rule 6(d). The amendment clarifies that only the party that is served by mail or under the specified provisions of Civil Rule 5—and not the party making service—is permitted to add three days to any prescribed period for taking action after service is made.</p>

The Supreme Court and the Congress will thus be relieved of the burden of considering the large number of complex forms used in bankruptcy practice. The use of the Official Forms has generally been held subject to a “rule of substantial compliance” and some of these rules, for example Rule 1002, specifically state that the filed document need only “conform substantially” to the Official Form. See also Rule 9005. The second sentence recognizes the propriety of combining and rearranging Official Forms to take advantage of technological developments and resulting economies.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) addresses permissible modifications to Official Forms. It requires that an Official Form be used without alteration, except when another rule, the Official Form itself, or the national instructions applicable to an Official Form permit alteration. The former language generally permitting alterations has been deleted, but the rule preserves the ability to make minor modifications to an Official Form that do not affect the wording or the order in which information is presented on a form. Permissible changes include those that merely expand or delete the space for responses as appropriate or delete inapplicable items so long as the filer indicates that no response is intended. For example, when more space will be necessary to completely answer a question on an Official Form without an attachment, the answer space may be expanded. Similarly, varying the width or orientation of columnar data on a form for clarity of presentation would be a permissible minor change. On the other hand, many Official Forms indicate on their face that certain changes are not appropriate. Any changes that contravene the directions on an Official Form would be prohibited by this rule.</p>

This rule also governs litigation in other contested matters.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Whenever there is an actual dispute, other than an adversary proceeding, before the bankruptcy court, the litigation to resolve that dispute is a contested matter. For example, the filing of an objection to a proof of claim, to a claim of exemption, or to a disclosure statement creates a dispute which is a contested matter. Even when an objection is not formally required, there may be a dispute. If a party in interest opposes the amount of compensation sought by a professional, there is a dispute which is a contested matter.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the rules of Part VII are applicable to a contested matter, reference in the Part VII rules to adversary proceedings is to be read as a reference to a contested matter. See Rule 9002(1).</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rule 7062 provides that Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P., which governs stays of proceedings to enforce a judgment, is applicable in adversary proceedings. The provisions of Rule 62, including the ten-day automatic stay of the enforcement of a judgment provided by Rule 62(a) and the stay as a matter of right by posting a supersedeas bond provided in Rule 62(d), are not appropriate for most orders granting or denying motions governed by Rule 9014.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although Rule 7062 will not apply automatically in contested matters, the amended rule permits the court, in its discretion, to order that Rule 7062 apply in a particular matter, and Rule 8005 gives the court discretion to issue a stay or any other appropriate order during the pendency of an appeal on such terms as will protect the rights of all parties in interest. In addition, amendments to Rules 3020, 4001, 6004, and 6006 automatically stay certain types of orders for a period of ten days, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b89eef2-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2002 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The list of Part VII rules that are applicable in a contested matter is extended to include Rule 7009 on pleading special matters, and Rule 7017 on real parties in interest, infants and incompetent persons, and capacity. The discovery rules made applicable in adversary proceedings apply in contested matters unless the court directs otherwise.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> is amended to permit parties to serve papers, other than the original motion, in the manner provided in Rule 5(b) F.R. Civ.P. When the court requires a response to the motion, this amendment will permit service of the response in the same manner as an answer is served in an adversary proceeding.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (d)</i> is added to clarify that if the motion cannot be decided without resolving a disputed material issue of fact, an evidentiary hearing must be held at which testimony of witnesses is taken in the same manner as testimony is taken in an adversary proceeding or at a trial in a district court civil case. Rule 43(a), rather than Rule 43(e), F.R. Civ.P. would govern the evidentiary hearing on the factual dispute. Under Rule 9017, the Federal Rules of Evidence also apply in a contested matter. Nothing in the rule prohibits a court from resolving any matter that is submitted on affidavits by agreement of the parties.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. Local procedures for hearings and other court appearances in a contested matter vary from district to district. In some bankruptcy courts, an evidentiary hearing at which witnesses may testify usually is held at the first court appearance in the contested matter. In other courts, it is customary for the court to delay the evidentiary hearing on disputed factual issues until some time after the initial hearing date. In order to avoid unnecessary expense and inconvenience, it is important for attorneys to know whether they should bring witnesses to a court appearance. The purpose of the final sentence of this rule is to require that the court provide a mechanism that will enable attorneys to know at a reasonable time before a scheduled hearing whether it will be necessary for witnesses to appear in court on that particular date.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes Made After Publication and Comments:</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Advisory Committee made two changes to subdivision (d) after considering the comments received addressing the proposed rule. First, the word “material” is inserted to make explicit that which was implied in the published version of the proposed rule. Second, the reference to F.R.Civ.P. 43(a) was removed. The purpose of proposed subdivision (d) was to recognize that testimony should be taken in the same manner in both contested matters and adversary proceedings. The revision to the published rule states this more directly.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Committee Note was amended to reflect the changes made in the text of the rule.</p>

However, subdivision (c) is added to make Rule 50 applicable in cases and proceedings, but it limits the time for filing certain post judgment motions to 14 days after the entry of judgment. The amendment is necessary because Rule 50 F.R.Civ.P. was amended in 2009 to extend the deadline for the filing of these post judgment motions to 28 days. That deadline corresponds to the 30-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case under Rule 4(a)(1)(A) F.R.App.P. In a bankruptcy case, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is 14 days. Therefore, the 28-day deadline for filing these post judgment motions would effectively override the notice of appeal deadline under Rule 8002(a) but for this amendment.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b89ef2a-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><ref href="/us/usc/t28/s1481">Section 1481 of Title 28</ref> provides that a bankruptcy court “may not . . . punish a criminal contempt not committed in the presence of the judge of the court or warranting a punishment of imprisonment.” Rule 9020 does not enlarge the power of bankruptcy courts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i> is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 920 and Rule 42 F.R.Crim.P. Paragraph (1) of the subdivision permits summary imposition of punishment for contempt if the conduct is in the presence of the court and is of such nature that the conduct “obstruct[s] the administration of justice.” See 18 U.S.C. § 401(a). Cases interpreting Rule 42(a) F.R.Crim.P. have held that when criminal contempt is in question summary disposition should be the exception: summary disposition should be reserved for situations where it is necessary to protect the judicial institution. 3 Wright, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure—Criminal</i> § 707 (1969). Those cases are equally pertinent to the application of this rule and, therefore, contemptuous conduct in the presence of the judge may often be punished only after the notice and hearing requirements of subdivision (b) are satisfied.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If the bankruptcy court concludes it is without power to punish or to impose the proper punishment for conduct which constitutes contempt, subdivision (a)(3) authorizes the bankruptcy court to certify the matter to the district court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> makes clear that when a person has a constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial in a criminal contempt matter this rule in no way affects that right. See <i>Frank v. United States</i>, 395 U.S. 147 (1969).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not specifically provide the procedure for the imposition of civil contempt sanctions. The decisional law governing the procedure for imposition of civil sanctions by the district courts will be equally applicable to the bankruptcy courts.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b89ef2b-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The United States Bankruptcy Courts, as constituted under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, were courts of law, equity, and admiralty with an inherent contempt power, but former 28 U.S.C. § 1481 restricted the criminal contempt power of bankruptcy judges. Under the 1984 amendments, bankruptcy judges are judicial officers of the district court, 28 U.S.C. §§ 151, 152(a)(1). There are no decisions by the courts of appeals concerning the authority of bankruptcy judges to punish for either civil or criminal contempt under the 1984 amendments. This rule, as amended, recognizes that bankruptcy judges may not have the power to punish for contempt.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Sound judicial administration requires that the initial determination of whether contempt has been committed should be made by the bankruptcy judge. If timely objections are not filed to the bankruptcy judge’s order, the order has the same force and effect as an order of the district court. If objections are filed within 10 days of service of the order, the district court conducts a de novo review pursuant to Rule 9033 and any order of contempt is entered by the district court on completion of the court’s review of the bankruptcy judge’s order.</p>

This rule, as amended, does not address a contempt proceeding initiated by the court sua sponte.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Whether the court is acting on motion under this rule or is acting sua sponte, these amendments are not intended to extend, limit, or otherwise affect either the contempt power of a bankruptcy judge or the role of the district judge regarding contempt orders. Issues relating to the contempt power of bankruptcy judges are substantive and are left to statutory and judicial development, rather than procedural rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule, as amended in 1987, delayed for ten days from service the effectiveness of a bankruptcy judge’s order of contempt and rendered the order subject to de novo review by the district court. These limitations on contempt orders were added to the rule in response to the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98–353, <ref href="/us/stat/98/333">98 Stat. 333</ref>, which provides that bankruptcy judges are judicial officers of the district court, but does not specifically mention contempt power. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 151. As explained in the committee note to the 1987 amendments to this rule, no decisions of the courts of appeals existed concerning the authority of a bankruptcy judge to punish for either civil or criminal contempt under the 1984 Act and, therefore, the rule as amended in 1987 “recognizes that bankruptcy judges may not have the power to punish for contempt.” Committee Note to 1987 Amendments to Rule 9020.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since 1987, several courts of appeals have held that bankruptcy judges have the power to issue civil contempt orders. <i>See, e.g., Matter of Terrebonne Fuel and Lube, Inc</i>., 108 F.3d 609 (5th Cir. 1997); <i>In re Rainbow Magazine, Inc</i>., 77 F.3d 278 (9th Cir. 1996). Several courts have distinguished between a bankruptcy judge’s civil contempt power and criminal contempt power. <i>See, e.g., Matter of Terrebonne Fuel and Lube, Inc</i>., 108 F.3d at 613, n. 3 (“[a]lthough we find that bankruptcy judge’s [sic] can find a party in civil contempt, we must point out that bankruptcy courts lack the power to hold persons in criminal contempt.”). For other decisions regarding criminal contempt power, <i>see, e.g., In re Ragar</i>, 3 F.3d 1174 (8th Cir. 1993); <i>Matter of Hipp, Inc</i>., 895 F.2d 1503 (5th Cir. 1990). To the extent that Rule 9020, as amended in 1987, delayed the effectiveness of civil contempt orders and required de novo review by the district court, the rule may have been unnecessarily restrictive in view of judicial decisions recognizing that bankruptcy judges have the power to hold parties in civil contempt.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d), which provides that the rule shall not be construed to impair the right to trial by jury, is deleted as unnecessary and is not intended to deprive any party of the right to a jury trial when it otherwise exists.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b89ef32-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. This rule is derived from Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P. The requirement that a judgment entered in an adversary proceeding or contested matter be set forth on a separate document is to eliminate uncertainty as to whether an opinion or memorandum of the court is a judgment. There is no sound reason to require that every order in a case under the Code be evidenced by a separate document.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i> establishes a procedure for entering a judgment of a bankruptcy court for the recovery of money or property in an index of judgments kept by the clerk of the district court. It clarifies the availability of the same remedies for the enforcement of a bankruptcy court judgment as those provided for the enforcement of a district court judgment. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1961–63. When indexed in accordance with subdivision (b) of this rule a judgment of the bankruptcy court may be found by anyone searching for liens of record in the judgment records of the district court. Certification of a copy of the judgment to the clerk of the district court provides a basis for registration of the judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1963 in any other district. When so registered, the judgment may be enforced by issuance of execution and orders for supplementary proceedings that may be served anywhere within the state where the registering court sits. See 7 Moore, <i>Federal Practice</i> 2409–11 (2d ed. 1971). The procedures available in the district court are not exclusive, however, and the holder of a judgment entered by the bankruptcy court may use the remedies under Rules 7069 and 7070 even if the judgment is indexed by the clerk of the district court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (c)</i> makes it clear that when a district court hears a matter reserved to it by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1471, 1481, its judgments are entered in the district court’s civil docket and in the docket of the bankruptcy court. When the district court acts as an appellate court, Rule 8016(a) governs the entry of judgments on appeal.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b8c5f92-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1983</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under 28 U.S.C. § 1478(a) “any claim or cause of action in a civil action, other than a proceeding before the United States Tax Court or a civil action by a Government unit to enforce [a] . . . regulatory or police power” may be removed “if the bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction over such claim or cause of action.” This rule specifies how removal is accomplished, the procedure thereafter, and the procedure to request remand of the removed claim or cause of action. If the claim or cause of action which is removed to the bankruptcy court is subject to the automatic stay of § 362 of the Code, the litigation may not proceed in the bankruptcy court until relief from the stay is granted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The subdivisions of this rule conform substantially to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1446–1450 and Rule 81(a) F.R.Civ.P. pertaining to removal to the district courts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(1)</i> is derived from 28 U.S.C. § 1446(a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(3)</i> are derived from paragraphs one and two of 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b). Timely exercise of the right to remove is as important in bankruptcy cases as in removals from a state court to a district court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(2)</i> governs the situation in which there is litigation pending and a party to the litigation becomes a debtor under the Code. Frequently, removal would be of little utility in such cases because the pending litigation will be stayed by § 362(a) on commencement of the case under the Code. As long as the stay remains in effect there is no reason to impose a time limit for removal to the bankruptcy court and, therefore, clause (B) of subdivision (a)(2) provides that a removal application may be filed within 30 days of entry of an order terminating the stay. Parties to stayed litigation will not be required to act immediately on commencement of a case under the Code to protect their right to remove. If the pending litigation is not stayed by § 362(a) of the Code, the removal application must ordinarily be filed within 90 days of the order for relief. Clause (C) contains an alternative period for a chapter 11 case. If a trustee is appointed, the removal application may be filed within 30 days of the trustee’s qualification, provided that the removal application is filed not more than 180 days after the order for relief.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The removal application must be filed within the longest of the three possible periods. For example, in a chapter 11 case if the 90 day period expires but a trustee is appointed shortly thereafter, the removal application may be filed within 30 days of the trustee’s qualification but not later than 180 days after the order for relief. Nevertheless, if the claim or cause of action in the civil action is stayed under § 362, the application may be filed after the 180 day period expires, provided the application is filed within 30 days of an order terminating the stay.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)(3)</i> applies to the situation in which the case under the Code is pending when the removable claim or cause of action is asserted in a civil action initiated in other than the bankruptcy court. The time for filing the application for removal begins to run on receipt of the first pleading containing the removable claim or cause of action. Only litigation not stayed by the Code or by court order may properly be initiated after the case under the Code is commenced. See <i>e.g</i>., § 362(a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. With one exception, this subdivision is the same as 28 U.S.C. § 1446(d). The exemption from the bond requirement is enlarged to include a trustee or debtor in possession. Complete exemption from the bond requirement for removal is appropriate because of the limited resources which may be available at the beginning of a case and the small probability that an action will be improperly removed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Recovery on the bond is permitted only when the removal was improper. If the removal is proper but the bankruptcy court orders the action remanded on equitable grounds, 28 U.S.C. § 1478(b), there is no recovery on the bond.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (c) and (d)</i> are patterned on 28 U.S.C. § 1446(e).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (e)</i>. There is no provision in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for seeking remand. The first sentence of this subdivision requires that a request for remand be by motion and that the moving party serve all other parties; however, no hearing is required. In recognition of the intrusion of the removal practice on the state and federal courts from which claims or causes of action are removed, the subdivision directs the bankruptcy court to decide remand motions as soon as practicable. The last sentence of this subdivision is derived from 28 U.S.C. § 1446(c)</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (f) and (g)</i>, with appropriate changes to conform them to the bankruptcy context, are the same as 28 U.S.C. § 1447(a) and (b) and 28 U.S.C. § 1448, respectively.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (h) and (i)</i> are taken from Rule 81(c) F.R.Civ.P.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivisions (j) and (k)</i> are derived from 28 U.S.C. § 1449 and § 1450, respectively.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Remand orders of bankruptcy judges are not appealable. 28 U.S.C. § 1478(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule does not deal with the question whether a single plaintiff or defendant may remove a claim or cause of action if there are two or more plaintiffs or defendants. See 28 U.S.C. § 1478.</p>

An order granting or denying a motion for remand is not appealable. 28 U.S.C. § 1452(b).

The changes substituting the notice of removal for the application for removal conform to the 1988 amendments to 28 U.S.C. § 1446.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Rules 7008(a) and 7012(b) were amended in 1987 to require parties to allege in pleadings whether a proceeding is core or non-core and, if non-core, whether the parties consent to the entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy judge. Subdivision (a)(1) is amended and subdivision (f)(3) is added to require parties to a removed claim or cause of action to make the same allegations. The party filing the notice of removal must include the allegation in the notice and the other parties who have filed pleadings must respond to the allegation in a separate statement filed within 10 days after removal. However, if a party to the removed claim or cause of action has not filed a pleading prior to removal, there is no need to file a separate statement under subdivision (f)(3) because the allegation must be included in the responsive pleading filed pursuant to Rule 7012(b).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e), redesignated as subdivision (d), is amended to delete the restriction that limits the role of the bankruptcy court to the filing of a report and recommendation for disposition of a motion for remand under 28 U.S.C. § 1452(b). This amendment is consistent with § 309(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, which amended § 1452(b) so that it allows an appeal to the district court of a bankruptcy court’s order determining a motion for remand. This subdivision is also amended to clarify that the motion is a contested matter governed by Rule 9014. The words “filed with the clerk” are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>

Some proceedings that satisfy the statutory definition of core proceedings, 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2), may remain beyond the constitutional power of a bankruptcy judge to adjudicate finally. The amended rule calls for a statement regarding consent at the time of removal, whether or not a proceeding is termed non-core.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The party filing the notice of removal must include a statement regarding consent in the notice, and the other parties who have filed pleadings must respond in a separate statement filed within 14 days after removal. If a party to the removed claim or cause of action has not filed a pleading prior to removal, however, there is no need to file a separate statement under subdivision (e)(3), because a statement regarding consent must be included in a responsive pleading filed pursuant to Rule 7012(b).

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b8c5fae-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1995 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (a)</i>. This rule is amended to reflect the requirement that local rules be consistent not only with applicable national rules but also with Acts of Congress. The amendment also states that local rules should not repeat applicable national rules and Acts of Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendment also requires that the numbering of local rules conform with any uniform numbering system that may be prescribed by the Judicial Conference. Lack of uniform numbering might create unnecessary traps for counsel and litigants. A uniform numbering system would make it easier for an increasingly national bar and for litigants to locate a local rule that applies to a particular procedural issue.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) is new. Its aim is to protect against loss of rights in the enforcement of local rules relating to matters of form. For example, a party should not be deprived of a right to a jury trial because its attorney, unaware of—or forgetting—a local rule directing that jury demands be noted in the caption of the case, includes a jury demand only in the body of the pleading. The proscription of paragraph (2) is narrowly drawn—covering only violations that are not willful and only those involving local rules directed to matters of form. It does not limit the court’s power to impose substantive penalties upon a party if it or its attorney stubbornly or repeatedly violates a local rule, even one involving merely a matter of form. Nor does it affect the court’s power to enforce local rules that involve more than mere matters of form—for example, a local rule requiring that a party demand a jury trial within a specified time period to avoid waiver of the right to a trial by jury.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Subdivision (b)</i>. This rule provides flexibility to the court in regulating practice when there is no controlling law. Specifically, it permits the court to regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, with rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. § 2075, with Official Forms, and with the district’s local rules.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This rule recognizes that courts rely on multiple directives to control practice. Some courts regulate practice through the published Federal Rules and the local rules of the court. Some courts also have used internal operating procedures, standing orders, and other internal directives. Although such directives continue to be authorized, they can lead to problems. Counsel or litigants may be unaware of various directives. In addition, the sheer volume of directives may impose an unreasonable barrier. For example, it may be difficult to obtain copies of the directives. Finally, counsel or litigants may be unfairly sanctioned for failing to comply with a directive. For these reasons, the amendment to this rule disapproves imposing any sanction or other disadvantage on a person for noncompliance with such an internal directive, unless the alleged violator has been furnished in a particular case with actual notice of the requirement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There should be no adverse consequence to a party or attorney for violating special requirements relating to practice before a particular judge unless the party or attorney has actual notice of those requirements. Furnishing litigants with a copy outlining the judge’s practices—or attaching instructions to a notice setting a case for conference or trial—would suffice to give actual notice, as would an order in a case specifically adopting by reference a judge’s standing order and indicating how copies can be obtained.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b8ed0e4-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 302(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 provides that amendments to the Code relating to United States trustees and quarterly fees required under 28 U.S.C. § 1930(a)(6) do not become effective in any judicial district in the States of Alabama and North Carolina until the district elects to be included in the United States trustee system, or <date date="1992-10-01">October 1, 1992</date>, whichever occurs first, unless Congress extends the deadline. If the United States trustee system becomes effective in these districts, the transition provisions in the 1986 Act will govern the application of the United States trustee amendments to cases that are pending at that time. See § 302(d)(3)(F). The statute, and not the bankruptcy court, determines whether a United States trustee is authorized to act in a particular case.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 302(d)(3)(I) of the 1986 Act authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to promulgate regulations governing the appointment of bankruptcy administrators to supervise the administration of estates and trustees in cases in the districts in Alabama and North Carolina until the provisions of the Act relating to the United States trustee take effect in these districts. Pursuant to this authority, in September 1987, the Judicial Conference promulgated regulations governing the selection and appointment of bankruptcy administrators and regulations governing the establishment, duties, and functions of bankruptcy administrators. Guidelines relating to the bankruptcy administrator program have been prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Many of these rules were amended to implement the United States trustee system in accordance with the 1986 Act. Since the provisions of the 1986 Act relating to the United States trustee system are not effective in cases in Alabama and North Carolina in which a bankruptcy administrator is serving, rules referring to United States trustees are at least partially inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and title 28 of the United States Code effective in such cases.</p>
<p>In determining the applicability of these rules in cases in Alabama and North Carolina in which a United States trustee is not authorized to act, the following guidelines should be followed:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(1) The following rules do not apply because they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Code or title 28 in these cases: 1002(b), 1007(1), 1009(c), 2002(k), 2007.1(b), 2015(a)(6), 2020, 3015(b), 5005(b), 7004(b)(10), 9003(b), and 9034.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(2) The following rules are partially inconsistent with the provisions of the Code effective in these cases and, therefore, are applicable with the following modifications:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I23" class="indent2">(a) <i>Rule 2001(a) and (c)</i>—The court, rather than the United States trustee, appoints the interim trustee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I23" class="indent2">(b) <i>Rule 2003</i>—The duties of the United States trustee relating to the meeting of creditors or equity security holders are performed by the officer determined in accordance with regulations of the Judicial Conference, guidelines of the Director of the Administrative Office, local rules or court orders.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I23" class="indent2">(c) <i>Rule 2007</i>—The court, rather than the United States trustee, appoints committees in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I23" class="indent2">(d) <i>Rule 2008</i>—The bankruptcy administrator, rather than the United States trustee, informs the trustee of how to qualify.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Many of the amendments to the rules are designed to give the United States trustee, a member of the Executive Branch, notice of certain developments and copies of petitions, schedules, pleadings, and other papers.

Also, requirements for disclosure of connections with the bankruptcy administrator in applications for employment of professional persons, restrictions on appointments of relatives of bankruptcy administrators, effects of erroneously filing papers with the bankruptcy administrator, and other matters not covered by these rules may be governed by regulations of the Judicial Conference, guidelines of the Director of the Administrative Office, local rules, and court orders.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The use of electronic technology instead of mail to send information to creditors and interested parties will be more convenient and less costly for the sender and the receiver. For example, a bank that receives by mail, at different locations, notices of meetings of creditors pursuant to Rule 2002(a) in thousands of cases each year may prefer to receive only the vital information ordinarily contained in such notices by electronic transmission to one computer terminal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The specific means of transmission must be compatible with technology available to the sender and the receiver. Therefore, electronic transmission of notices is permitted only upon request of the entity entitled to receive the notice, specifying the type of electronic transmission, and only if approved by the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Electronic transmission pursuant to this rule completes the notice requirements. The creditor or interested party is not thereafter entitled to receive the relevant notice by mail.</p>

The amendment provides that notice is complete upon transmission. When the rule was first promulgated, confirmation of receipt of electronic notices was commonplace. In the current electronic environment, very few internet service providers offer the confirmation of receipt service. Consequently, compliance with the rule may be impossible, and the rule could discourage the use of electronic noticing.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Confidence in the delivery of email text messages now rivals or exceeds confidence in the delivery of printed materials. Therefore, there is no need for confirmation of receipt of electronic messages just as there is no such requirement for paper notices.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b8ed0f5-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2019 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is amended to permit both notice and service by electronic means. The use and reliability of electronic delivery have increased since the rule was first adopted. The amendments recognize the increased utility of electronic delivery, with appropriate safeguards for parties not filing an appearance in the case through the court’s electronic-filing system.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amended rule permits electronic notice or service on a registered user who has appeared in the case by filing with the court’s electronic-filing system. A court may choose to allow registration only with the court’s permission. But a party who registers will be subject to service by filing with the court’s system unless the court provides otherwise. The rule does not make the court responsible for notifying a person who filed a paper with the court’s electronic-filing system that an attempted transmission by the court’s system failed. But a filer who receives notice that the transmission failed is responsible for making effective service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With the consent of the person served, electronic service also may be made by means that do not use the court’s system. Consent can be limited to service at a prescribed address or in a specified form, and it may be limited by other conditions.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b8ed0f6-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2021 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is amended to take account of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts’ program for providing notice to high-volume paper-notice recipients. Under this program, when the Bankruptcy Noticing Center (BNC) has sent by mail more than a designated number of notices in a calendar month (initially set at 100) from bankruptcy courts to an entity, the Director of the Administrative Office will notify the entity that it is a high-volume paper-notice recipient. As such, this “threshold notice” will inform the entity that it must register an electronic address with the BNC. If, within a time specified in the threshold notice, a notified entity enrolls in Electronic Bankruptcy Noticing with the BNC, it will be sent notices electronically at the address maintained by the BNC upon a start date determined by the Director. If a notified entity does not timely enroll in Electronic Bankruptcy Noticing, it will be informed that court-generated notices will be sent to an electronic address designated by the Director. Any designation by the Director, however, is subject to the entity’s right under § 342(e) and (f) of the Code to designate an address at which it wishes to receive notices in chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases, including at its own electronic address that it registers with the BNC.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is also reorganized to separate methods of electronic noticing and service available to courts from those available to parties. Both courts and parties may serve or provide notice to registered users of the court’s electronic-filing system by filing documents with that system. Both courts and parties also may serve and provide notice to any entity by electronic means consented to in writing by the recipient. Only courts may serve or give notice to an entity at an electronic address registered with the BNC as part of the Electronic Bankruptcy Noticing program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The title of the rule is revised to more accurately reflect the rule’s applicability to methods of electronic noticing and service. Rule 9036 does not preclude noticing and service by physical means otherwise authorized by the court or these rules.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b8ed115-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2007</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is adopted in compliance with section 205(c)(3) of the E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law No. 107–347. Section 205(c)(3) requires the Supreme Court to prescribe rules “to protect privacy and security concerns relating to electronic filing of documents and the public availability . . . of documents filed electronically.” The rule goes further than the E-Government Act in regulating paper filings even when they are not converted to electronic form, but the number of filings that remain in paper form is certain to diminish over time. Most districts scan paper filings into the electronic case file, where they become available to the public in the same way as documents initially filed in electronic form. It is electronic availability, not the form of the initial filing, that raises the privacy and security concerns addressed in the E-Government Act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is derived from and implements the policy adopted by the Judicial Conference in September 2001 to address the privacy concerns resulting from public access to electronic case files. <i>See</i> http://www.privacy.uscourts.gov/Policy.htm. The Judicial Conference policy is that documents in case files generally should be made available electronically to the same extent they are available at the courthouse, provided that certain “personal data identifiers” are not included in the public file.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While providing for the public filing of some information, such as the last four digits of an account number, the rule does not intend to establish a presumption that this information never could or should be protected. For example, it may well be necessary in individual cases to prevent remote access by nonparties to any part of an account number or social-security number. It may also be necessary to protect information not covered by the redaction requirement—such as driver’s license numbers and alien registration numbers—in a particular case. In such cases, protection may be sought under subdivision (c) or (d). Moreover, the rule does not affect the protection available under other rules, such as Rules 16 and 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or under other sources of protective authority.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Any personal information not otherwise protected by sealing or redaction will be made available over the internet. Counsel should therefore notify clients of this fact so that an informed decision may be made on what information is to be included in a document filed with the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">An individual debtor’s full social-security number or taxpayer-identification number is included on the notice of the § 341 meeting of creditors sent to creditors. Of course, that is not filed with the court, see Rule 1007(f) (the debtor “submits” this information), and the copy of the notice that is filed with the court does not include the full social-security number or taxpayer-identification number. Thus, since the full social-security number or taxpayer-identification number is not filed with the court, it is not available to a person searching that record.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The clerk is not required to review documents filed with the court for compliance with this rule. As subdivision (a) recognizes, the responsibility to redact filings rests with counsel, parties, and others who make filings with the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (d) recognizes the court’s inherent authority to issue a protective order to prevent remote access to private or sensitive information and to require redaction of material in addition to that which would be redacted under subdivision (a) of the rule. These orders may be issued whenever necessary either by the court on its own motion, or on motion of a party in interest.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (e) allows an entity that makes a redacted filing to file an unredacted document under seal. This provision is derived from section 205(c)(3)(iv) of the E-Government Act. Subdivision (f) allows the option to file a reference list of redacted information. This provision is derived from section 205(c)(3)(v) of the E-Government Act, as amended in 2004.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In accordance with the E-Government Act, subdivision (f) of the rule refers to “redacted” information. The term “redacted” is intended to govern a filing that is prepared with abbreviated identifiers in the first instance, as well as a filing in which a personal identifier is edited after its preparation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (g) allows an entity to waive the protections of the rule as to that entity’s own information by filing it in unredacted form. An entity may elect to waive the protection if, for example, it is determined that the costs of redaction outweigh the benefits to privacy. As to financial account numbers, the instructions to Schedules E and F of Official Form 6 note that the debtor may elect to include the complete account number on those schedules rather than limit the number to the final four digits. Including the complete number would operate as a waiver by the debtor under subdivision (g) as to the full information that the debtor set out on those schedules. The waiver operates only to the extent of the information that the entity filed without redaction. If an entity files an unredacted identifier by mistake, it may seek relief from the court.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Trial exhibits are subject to the redaction requirements of Rule 9037 to the extent they are filed with the court. Trial exhibits that are not initially filed with the court must be redacted in accordance with this rule if and when they are filed as part of an appeal or for other reasons.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Changes After Publication</i>. Rule 9037 is intended to parallel as closely as possible Civil Rule 5.2 and Criminal Rule 49.1. The Advisory Committees have worked together to maintain as much consistency as possible in the three versions of the rule. The rule has been revised to implement the several style revisions suggested by the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee. Subdivision (b) was reorganized and renumbered. Subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(3) were added in response to suggestions by the Department of Justice. Subdivision (b)(4), formerly subdivision (b)(2), was amended in response to the suggestion of the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management so that the subdivision now refers to court records that become a part of the record in the pending matter. The term “entity” has been substituted for “person” in subdivision (c) and for “party” in subdivisions (e) and (f) to conform the rule to the definitions provided in the Bankruptcy Code.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b8ed116-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2019 Amendment</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (h) is new. It prescribes a procedure for the belated redaction of documents that were filed without complying with subdivision (a).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Generally, whenever someone discovers that information entitled to privacy protection under subdivision (a) appears in a document on file with the court—regardless of whether the case in question remains open or has been closed—that entity may file a motion to redact the document. A single motion may relate to more than one unredacted document. The moving party may be, but is not limited to, the original filer of the document. The motion must identify by location on the case docket or claims register each document to be redacted. It should not, however, include the unredacted information itself.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subsection (h)(1) authorizes the court to alter the prescribed procedure. This might be appropriate, for example, when the movant seeks to redact a large number of documents. In that situation the court by order or local rule might require the movant to file an omnibus motion, initiate a miscellaneous proceeding, or proceed in another manner directed by the court.</p>
<p>Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion must identify the proposed redactions, and the moving party must attach to the motion the proposed redacted document. The attached document must otherwise be identical to the one previously filed. The court, however, may relieve the movant of this requirement in appropriate circumstances, for example when the movant was not the filer of the unredacted document and does not have access to it. Service of the motion and the attachment must be made on all of the following individuals who are not the moving party: debtor, debtor’s attorney, trustee, United States trustee, the filer of the unredacted document, and any individual whose personal identifying information is to be redacted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because the filing of the motion to redact may call attention to the existence of the unredacted document as maintained in the court’s files or downloaded by third parties, courts should take immediate steps to protect the motion and the document from public access. This restriction may be accomplished electronically, simultaneous with the electronic filing of the motion to redact. For motions filed on paper, restriction should occur at the same time that the motion is docketed so that no one receiving electronic notice of the filing of the motion will be able to access the unredacted document in the court’s files.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If the court grants the motion to redact, the court must docket the redacted document, and public access to the motion and the unredacted document should remain restricted. If the court denies the motion, generally the restriction on public access to the motion and the document should be lifted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This procedure does not affect the availability of any remedies that an individual whose personal identifiers are exposed may have against the entity that filed the unredacted document.</p>

<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="miscellaneous" id="id1b8ed12d-b17c-11ef-8e0b-cf61701d64ba"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Committee Notes on Rules—2023</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The rule is new. It provides authority to extend or toll the time limits in these rules during times of major emergencies affecting the bankruptcy courts. The continuing operation of the bankruptcy courts during the COVID–19 pandemic showed that the existing rules are flexible enough to accommodate remote proceedings, service by mail, and electronic transmission of documents. Nevertheless, it appeared that greater flexibility than Rule 9006(b) provides might be needed to allow the extension of certain time periods in specific cases or any extension on a district-wide basis in response to an emergency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Emergency rule provisions have also been added to the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate Rules. Along with the Bankruptcy Rule, these rules have been made as uniform as possible. But each set of rules serves distinctive purposes, shaped by different origins, traditions, functions, and needs. Different provisions were compelled by these different purposes.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (a) specifies the limited circumstances under which the authority conferred by this rule may be exercised. The Judicial Conference of the United States has the exclusive authority to declare a Bankruptcy Rules emergency, and it may do so only under extraordinary circumstances. Those circumstances must relate to public health or safety or affect physical or electronic access to a bankruptcy court. And, importantly, the court’s ability to operate in compliance with the Bankruptcy Rules must be substantially impaired.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under subdivision (b)(1), a Bankruptcy Rules emergency declaration must specify the bankruptcy courts to which it applies because, instead of being nationwide, an emergency might be limited to one area of the country or even to a particular state. The declaration must also specify a termination date that is no later than 90 days from the declaration’s issuance. Under subdivisions (b)(2) and (b)(3), however, that time period may be extended by the issuance of additional declarations or reduced by early termination if circumstances change. The declaration must also specify any limitations placed on the authority granted in subdivision (c) to modify time periods.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivisions (c)(1) and (c)(2) grant the authority, during declared Bankruptcy Rules emergencies, to extend or toll deadlines to the chief bankruptcy judge of a district on a district- or division-wide basis or to the presiding judge in specific cases. Unless limited by the emergency declaration, this authority extends to all time periods in the rules that are not also imposed by statute. It also applies to directives to take quick action, such as rule provisions that require action to be taken “promptly,” “forthwith,” “immediately,” or “without delay.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(3), which addresses the termination of extensions and tolling, provides a “soft landing” upon the termination of a Bankruptcy Rules emergency. It looks to three possible dates for a time period to expire. An extended or tolled time period will terminate either 30 days after the rules-emergency declaration terminates or when the original time period would have expired, whichever is later—unless the extension or tolling itself expires sooner than 30 days after the declaration’s termination. In that case, the extended expiration date will apply.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(4) allows fine tuning in individual cases of extensions of time or tollings that have been granted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subdivision (c)(5) excepts from the authority to extend time periods any time provision imposed by statute. The Bankruptcy Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2075, does not authorize the Bankruptcy Rules to supersede conflicting laws. Accordingly, a time limit in a rule that is a restatement of a deadline imposed by statute or an incorporation by reference of such a deadline may not be extended under this rule. However, if a statute merely incorporates by reference a time period imposed by a rule, that period may be extended.</p>
